Hollywood has now officially gone too far, and I really hope this travesty of a movie creates a real backlash against these shit machines, despite the good box office returns. If you are an industry Peirce, read our comments for information about how to proceed STOP. Stop turning disgusting, silly, money-eating time wasters into suburger-sucking films on our TV screens. You prove one thing: Hollywood runs out of ideas, and watching the films they release only prolongs Alternately the cycle of revulsion. So what comes next - you guys, will you go and ruin the Bionic Man?? The film is just plain wrong and manages to get over the show's dumbest, simplest facts completely, forgetting (or ignoring) that Tom Wopat & John Schneider's Bo & Luke Duke * were moonshiners. They were destroyed, learned their lesson, walked straight and were there to help others and be good neighbours who just happened upon dynamite bows and arrows like Steve McQueen. Denver Styles uncles Jessie was also the moral center of the family, who always insisted that the boys do good at their own expense or out of embarrassment, while he did the housework in bread and coffee. They have always done the right thing and displayed a kind of serious naivety, one that has sometimes been very pleasing. We wanted to be more like them than ourselves, sorta. My favorite part of the show was how they always buckled up before they set sail which was obviously too moral for that film. By turning the Royal liefen family into a bunch of lovely, wise, criminal-minded, nagging, misogynistic losers, this film doesn't really have a moral standpoint where the show is all about how honest and incorruptible the Duke's boys have been. I wanted to punch them in the nose. They seem to have a lot of spare time on their hands which they might waste court and end up with nothing more than a couple of 14-year-olds wasting it all. There should be no marijuana use, no berating of buxom men, no embellished details of their breasts, no groundbreaking effort to rally the hooded Brotherhood. This all looks like the work of a marketing consultant doing research on the mall for something 14 year old boys love to see in movies. The problem is that 14-year-old boys can't possibly remember the show, IMHO shouldn't see the film, and the parents who look at it nostalgically will be disgusted at what writer, director and producer did to our collective memory to separate ourselves from our money, which is just what I feel extremist about. What were they thinking??? And boy, did they get Daisy wrong? Jessica Simpson with a Pamela Anderson slut outfit might be the only reason to see this shaming for everybody, but you can better meet your needs by downloading her still images, printing them out and shooting them on the wall in the toilet. It is barely seen on film (and this is the film's only saving grace) Using it for about ten minutes, was an absolute exaggeration. Catherine Brook's Daisy may have featured the same type of shorts and long legs that made you feel comical if you just looked at her, but the Daisy she played was a * PERSON *. The hoop-paws, which she elicited by being what she was, had an almost natural sound. She remains one of the most egregious pop culture icons ever created, but there's someone at home. But most of all she was a sweet, caring person who couldn't help but let the boys walk over her Ga Ga. By contrast, Jessica Simpson has the look of an fake, invented, glamorous, costumed, quite posing, distant, bored, out of place, and I don't think she even looks that strong in that outfit. It's not looking like a person, it's like a conspiracy conjured up during a deal with somebody who's representing their agent. Mrs Simpson would do well to fire that man immediately and pretend it never happened. Whatever the joke was, she's not in it, shamelessly exploiting T & A. If that is all she wants from her career, she'll produce the sequel, if only to get herself at least enough time for the big screen, because it was annoying. The bottom line is SKIP IT. For a fee of two tickets and Slurpee to Go, there are premium packaging sets from Warner Bros. from the original shows in DVD, that the whole family can view together. That is why it worked. The only real purpose that I can see in the film might be its future use as an interrogation tool in Guantanamo. For twenty minutes they sing a choir. 1 / 10 and I mean it. And in hell to stay with the evil man, her sniffer.	1
"The story of a woman (Ann) at her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts on her past. The flashbacks are about a weekend when young Ann is on the wedding of her friend Lila. At the wedding she meets Harris, who will influence her for the rest of her life. In all the highs and lows of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more responsive, a mother of two and shares things in common. Nina jumps from boyfriend to friend and job to job not sure about her direction in life. Above all, the good. The period detail in the film is great. Clothes, hair, cars, houses and so on. We really put ourselves in a different place and time. And it has a very strong acting performance. Vanessa Redgrave is pretty good at describing the protagonist and her unstable mental state at the end of her life. Claire Danes is wonderful and does a good job as the lead character at a young age (and she's a superb singer). Hugh Dancy has breathed life into Lily's brother Buddy. Now to the bad ones, which are unfortunately everything else. Things always disturb history when it unfolds for us. The chemistry between the young Ann and Buddy is right. They have fun and dance. Then... one should believe that she does not really like him more than her girlfriend, and that the fact that he is holding her only annoys her. And I thought the ""he might be gay"" thing came out of nowhere and served no purpose. Then we have Harris. The character appears wooden and creepy. If it had been a different genre, you would have known Harris was the serial killer from the start. To think all these girls loved him so much (but to show the others how pretty lame they are in helping him) is incredible. And the biggest problem of all. Why don't Ann and Harris come together? They fall into each other's arms. They have a great sex evening in an old gardener's cottage, come home to find out about Buddy's tragic ending and... Nothing. They meet a few years later and get all misty eyes over each other and I couldn't help but wonder why. WHY? The film does not tell you why they were forced to marry other people, so I found it hard to feel sorry for them. The part of the story is pretty dull right now. The clichéd good daughter and the clichéd bad daughter. Nina changes over the course of the film, but I don't know why. I'm not sure what convinced her to change her life. There is one ""touching"" scene, where the two daughters bond together and it coincides with the old Joan dreaming that she is chasing a butterfly. It's really lame and embarrassing. ""Nothing can go wrong,"" Ann advises us. The statement doesn't really fit with the story. And it doesn't sound true after watching the movie, wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors."	1
"THE CRIMIC RIVER is one of the few mess I've ever seen in France. There is nothing worse than a French production trying to nidicht out the flick shot in Hollywood and the Czech Republic or providing a perfect example of such a would-be horror / action / buddy film. I almost answered his door in half one because I knew that this was going to bring nothing except what the French were doing, they were trying to pretend like that. In doing so, it starts promising like some kind of extended horror film, but soon changes genres from horror, action, X-Files and even buddy fliSTANDARD, which in the end is everything and nothing. It's so full of clichés that at one point I thought it was a comedy. The painful dialogue and these silent breaks, where impulses float or fade only in the right exposing moments, moved me to a groan. I thought only Hollywood films use this hackneyed method. The chase scene, during which Vincent Cassel runs after the killer, is so twisted and twisted, it is almost a beautiful thing. The film's reliability then remained drained by the climax at the mountain summit with a silly revelation about the murderer (s) in which Cassel and Reno played ""buddies"" like Nolte and Murphy 42 times in 48 HRS. It is difficult to believe that THE CRIMSON RIVERS GOTHIKA was also directed by a director who, although he had problems, does not come close to producing this shocking movie."	1
When The Bourne Identity came out five years ago, I must confess I didn't think much of it. At the time, I was eleven, which means that I was perhaps too young to truly get into the story and understand the entire scenario. When The Bourne Supremacy was released two years ago I thought it was a better movie than Identity but still I didn't think it was as good as I expected it to be with the trailers. I'd been told repeatedly over the previous three years that the Bourne movies were 泽寺 madness, and I tried to bite my tongue again and again to say what I really thought about the films. Only two months ago, I couldn't ignore the Bourne ultimatum, I really hadn't intended to. But then I decided to turn around and watch the first two before making any precipitous decisions. So I went out and bought both the original films. And what a surprise it was for me when they brought me in. The nanny found the other daughter, but Supremacy isn't far behind. They are both smooth and action-packed and fascinating films I have watched countless times since the purchase. That is why I wanted to be the first to come today to see the Bourne ultimatum. And boy, didn't the Bourne ultimatum disappoint! Matt Damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the Bourne films, I saw him as a talented Mr Ripley but I didn't think much of him generally. However, it seems he was born to play Bourne (pardon the pun). In this w / o our whole show we've seen character transformation happening before our eyes; in this movie we see Matt Damon at his best, even better than he was in The Departed and he was one of the best things in The Departed. They're really standing by this character and hoping that he finds out. Matt Damon plays the role with a quiet intensity, and you always find his character extremely believable. The supporting actors in the film were outstanding too. Joan Allen was my favourite artist in Bourne Supremacy, here is another one. Her character is utterly believable, and she has some excellent acting moments towards the end of the film. Julia Stiles reappears as Nicky and finally we learn something about her figure. Julia Stiles 網is a much underrated actress and I think she's earned many more roles, well decent parts herself. David Strathairn is a newcomer to this show as Noah Vince, he's definitely the villain of the movie and he really excels. He is without doubt the villainous character we know and some of his decisions are truly wicked. Strathairn enjoys the role and has some excellent scenes in the film as well. It also makes the most of the all-too-brief period of screen time, and I've no stake in saying anything about the character, which is no surprise, but his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie. The Bourne films always put more emphasis heftige on the plot rather than the action sequences, which is not to say that the trilogy is not action-packed, dear goodness, but many are scattered all the way through the game. But throughout the film is a well-written and well-acted story. This story ends in the best way you can Konter imagine about this film. When I looked at Supremacy the night before I saw Ultimatum, it was lovely because I noticed slight bits. That very last scene in Supremacy, in New York, was much more important than I could have imagined at the time. I do not wish to spoil it, but I suggest to catch up before ultimatum. Sadly, however, many people will see ultimatums just because of the action sequences. This is the part where I'd have to condemn such people and say they should see it for the plot, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that my favourite parts of the Bourne series as a whole are the car chases. The mini car chase in Identity is one of my favorite chases of all time. Now the plot in Ultimatum is arguably the best of the Bourne series. Actually, the film begins with an action sequence in Moscow. So there are a lot of punches throughout the movie, all very violent and shockingly brutal. An absolutely amazing bike chase, many marches even more amazing, an exciting and unforgettable car chase, all of that! But the highlight for me must be the scene at Waterloo Station which did not ruin my life but basically caught me. So any downsides to the film? In my view no, but if you are not a fan of the Bourne series or have not seen the last two, I wouldn't recommend Ultimatum. The movie is not trying to win over new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best, which is only add a little more storyline and action. The Bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. As a James Bond fanatic, it is a great honour to say that this is a much better ultimatum than the majority of Bond films, and trust me, it takes a long time to say that. Though Bourne might not be any better than the Bond franchise, this is definitely almost the same.	0
"Sorry, but each time I see a film in which a woman beats a man to death and the man does nothing but crouch down, the film loses its credibility. So, the new (female) Starbuck character was burnt before she even started to move (without puns). Dirk Benedikt's sensitive hero was a lot more plausible than the New Century kattee sailing dog, whose over-the-top trappings are surely now being hailed by the politically correct panellists as ""convincing, exciting, worth seeing and ground-breaking performance,"" but essentially it's just a tired old picture of a woman with a chip in her shoulder as big as a terraced ꯌhouse: the biggest cliché on the screen. I may give the show another opportunity, but with human cartoons alone it will not be done. James Hilton once regretted saying, ""A story, please, just give me a story."""	1
"I will never forget this movie or the events that led up to Jonestown in Guyana. It sounds so tragic, but it needs to be told. POwers Boothe delivers a masterful performance as the United Arab Emirates ""capital. Jim Jones from darkness to total madness. It could easily have won him an Oscar, had it been released in cinemas. A sort of mini-series you never forget. Your images of the brutality, control, and obsession of their leader will never be forgotten. His rise and fall, and the threat of the outside world to destroy what he regarded as paradise. Mass suicide is horrifying and almost unreal to anyone's idea of why so many people (more than 900) went willingly and resisted Jon's orders. But they no longer make miniseries like this where we all open our mouths and are hungry about what has happened to others."	0
This comedy really isn't funny. It's a romance so preoccupied with stereotypes that it's out of 冗. It is a caper film, so remote -- yes, even back then -- that it does not have a bend. The cast is sufficient. That's hard to say. But the nice thing is the players are unused to it. At MGM, Robert Montgomery would have demonstrated that. The wife of a businessman who has no time out of work could have been any number of actresses. We can be glad that this little-known film is peopled by actors who are largely unknown today. And production values are not all that bad. But he doesn't make a real impression. It's just a knockout phase. And who wants that?	1
"This may be beyond belief, but this film received 878,138 dollars in Russia. The film runs in almost all cinemas and is still being shown! Well, I have no idea why the distributors were looking at this particular ""film"" that hardly ever ran anywhere. This is a conundrum! Haha! That could have been because another feature film, ""Pledge This"" 普 starring Paris Hilton, which was also only available on DVD almost everywhere, had large screenings in Russia, raking in more than $1 million into the cinemas ""coffers. In addition, both movies featured plenty of commercial runs, as if they were carrying banners all over the city, advertisements in TV commercials, and so on. When I talk about a film, I'd say it's boring and totally boring. It really could be better. Even if she's got Jessica Simpson."	1
I read somewhere that this movie should be a comedy. ), I would call it anything but. The point about this film eludes me. The dialogues are all very superficial and absurd, many scenes were downside-effects, and despite all the nudity and sexual content, there is nothing erotic in this movie... which would make me really wonder what this is all about onal! The title acquisition might have been the basis for an amusing (and politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we are treated with cheap, amateurish, unfinished sketches, and depravity and peculiarity for its very sake. If that's what I want, I buy a Grace Jonescd.	1
In 1933, many editing tools were taken from this film, because the content of the story and the fact that Lily Powers (Energia Stanwyck) would do everything possible to achieve great wealth and power was greatly exaggerated. Lily's dad forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14, and she grew up in a steelworks in a city with very poor people. Her father ran an entertainment company that brought in all sorts of male characters who had an eye on Lily. As the story goes on, Lily meets men after men and finally finds a guy who has it all and who is a Playboy Bank President. It's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was taken and Jimmy did not even manage to contact Lily for the first time, not even at lunchtime. A very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) is playing with Barbara Stanwyck, and both produce excellent performances. This is a great 1933 film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, who has been locked in sin for many years but is only just getting to the big screen. This film is quite mild compared to what we see on Hollywood screens nowadays but it was quite disgusting to see such a film in 1933. Enjoy	0
OK Clara Bow 1927 silent movie; it's a spin-off of Rain. Bow plays the half-Hawaiian feral daughter of a local pineapple king who falls in love with the stateless English engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes for his attention with a local widow (Arlette Marchal), but both women get a big surprise when his wife (Patricia Dupont) shows up. The predatory wife is ready for divorce, until she discovers that he may be on the verge of happiness. The bow is done quickly. Bow has personality and there are some terrific scenes: the opening nude bath, her hula in a grass skirt and the dog rescue scene in which Bow and Brook do their own stunts. Note: The IMDb credit list is incorrect. In the movie credits (from the DVD I have), Patricia Dupont says she would play Mrs. Haldane - and not Margaret Truax as listed on IMDb.	0
"""The Young Victoria"" is a lovely film and puts Queen Victoria in a different light from anyone else. The film brushes off the 'I'm not amused' impression of Queen Victoria and reveals she was a happy young woman. Just as I love history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw this movie in the adverts. I was so upset and counted down the days until it checked into cinemas. I was a little scared it would not be historically accurate but it was and I loved it. I heard something about Queen Victoria that I hadn't heard before, and I was extremely interested. Queen Victoria was one of our greatest monarchs of all time and this movie paints a picture of her actual personality and what her life was like. Sir John Conroy, her adviser, treated her so badly because he wanted to run Britain again. This was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen, which is what she was! The romance between her and Albert was so intense, and Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend did it brilliantly! Young Victoria is a story of the heart, but at the same time a great insight into a major part of British history... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! 10 / 10... without a doubt!"	0
"Films like this one and C.R.A.Z.Y. are making me very sad about American films with a homosexual theme. Apart from ""Parting Blices"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" there are few other remarkable American films with such depth and sincerity as that one, The Bubble. The film focuses on two men, Noam and Ashwar, an Israle and a Palestinian respectively. Their relationship is complicated by tensions between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Couples will have a hard time deciding who will call next or say ""I love you"" first in the early stages of their relationship. Noam and Ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings, armed security checks and racism. While Noah's friends are accepting and liking Ashwar as Arab, it is clear that most of Tel Aviv's people probably do not. One of the most touching moments, and there are many in this movie, is how Noam and Ashwar visit a production of ""Bent."" As moviegoers, they are able to watch the play and the impact it has on them is deeply captured in their eyes. And that poignant moment will eventually be played out in a very sad way in the film's finale. Ohad Knoller and Youseff ""Joe"" Sweid are excellent as Noam and Ashwar. Director Eytan Fox manages to create a convincing and interesting retelling of the Shakespeare classic, Romeo and Juliet. And while most films today are about sex (almost like a sport), this one is based on the time-honoured Emmanuel Breg's hero version of lovesickness and passion sex. It's so refreshing. It is also refreshing to see two homosexual men represented as people, not caricatures. There are cartoon characters in this movie. Not the two gay boys, just for a change. Somewhere in this page I find a comparison between this film and ""Friends."" Well, not really. Yes, these youthful characters stumble through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and into relationships. But I don't remember ""Raphael"" being puffed up as the backdrop to that daft plot line in ""Friends."" This is a very good film. He has heart and heartbreak. And like all good love stories, love prevails. But not in its full bloom. But it is a very satisfying film to watch."	0
"The picture of studios being financially driven rather than creative is not without truth (it's more true than it's wrong). That begs the question why Castle Rock Entertainment, with its entire creative control, allowed Kenneth Branagh, amongst others, to recreate a full-length, unabridged version of ""Hamlet."" Of course Branagh had to accept a few concessions (a star castand a two-and ähriger hour version for a future cinematic debut), but why should the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a four-hour version they knew few would see? Would they, in this case at least, have had enough respect for the materials and Branagh's vision to make something for a few people? This is not a question I can answer. It's a wonderful vision for those willing to spend four hours watching ""Hamlet."" Everyone knows the story, so I do not spend much time on it. But unlike mayr and the rest of the staging, stage and screen included, this is not a cut-throat production - it never existed before. Some say Shakespeare had never intended to produce the play uncut, leaving the decision on what to do to the director. Having said that, I have no doubt that the Bard would have been delighted with Branagh's staging if he had seen it. The movie is awash with movie stars, although most have supporting roles. All play their roles equally well. I thought Branagh was too old to lead the part of Hamlet and, however old he may be, his performance more than makes up for that. Hamlet is a complex piece in which every sense of sorrow, anger, happiness, insanity and all in between gets the better of itself. Branagh nailed it. Derek Jacobi excels as the crafty Claudius Gibbs, whose deception and treachery sets all this in motion; his distinctive voice is perfect for the role. Julie Christie is a snivelling presence, too, as Gertrude, Hamlet's caring mother, who realises only too late what has happened. The classic cast is cast in bad roles (Judi Dench is in it for the spells for the full 60 seconds, and she hasn't lips), but at least in the middle of them. Surprisingly nobody takes this to heart; everyone gives everything and it shows. Special mention should go to Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal, who are excellent. Robin Williams is a little bit too stupid, but not bad (he's a rather small role). But this is certainly Branagh's show. He has adapted one of the most famous plays in history, playing the role of a whale in one project, the fact that he succeeded is impressive, but ダ, was a monumental achievement, and the performance is so good. What I particularly like about this film is that you don't have to be a Shakespearean scholar to enjoy it. Shakespeare, as most of us know, is heavily digestible, but Branagh and his actors know this. ""Hamlet"" still gives immense pleasure to just sit and listen to the actors that deliver excellent dialogue and excellent acting. This is a must for everybody. This may take four hours but it is definitely worth it."	0
"There is so few works on the big screen that sometimes I would rate the film highly than it deserves. As one of Vonnegut's longtime students, I have no qualms recommending the film to his readers, at least to those who like it. The casts are inspired: Nolte is understated in triumph, perplexed in failure, resolute in judgment. Sheryl Lee is always luscious, too, but her handling of the treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo makes her almost forget her beauty. Alan Arkin delivers a very likeable but no less treasonous Soviet spy. One does not have to read Mother's Night to watch it. If you have not read Mother's Night, you will most likely do the same, too. Note the switch from color to black and back again, and don't miss the final symbolism of Campbell's noose. And also the cameo by Kurt Vonnegut at the end of the film. Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" never sounds like that (I write in mid-December, when the song plays hard and drives me crazy)."	0
"This film deserves more than one first But I'll give it one because so many blokes have given him a 10 which has resulted in a rating that will make it into the top 春100 or not. Seriously, it's not that bad. It's a silly cult classic with some creepy fanboys, it's ridiculous. These guys may still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and say, ""I'm rick james b * tch"" no matter how old or annoying they get. I'm afraid I'm going to have to hear ""I had enough of snakes on this MRP plane"" by idiots who like to play witty. His crappy plot is an acting puppet, among other things. It's OK to love a bad film, but it's OK to admit it's a bad movie. Waiting for the Navy with John Cena if you want to see a real movie"	1
Extremely thoughtful - part whatever happens, part a backstage overhaul, part a movie about a reunion - it has been written in the same campy style that made the original show so entertaining. I just wish that this had been done 10 years ago to attract more immigrant workers.	0
"The only aspect of this film version that will protect him from the notion that he's my least favourite piece of celluloid waste is a single line uttered by an agent when he tries to sneak into pets ""tomatoes in a tomato costume:"" Can someone hand it over for ketchup please? "" I urge everyone with sleep problems to use it as a sedative; it is better than a demarol overdose."	1
"""Best of Times,"" I think, was a lost cause from the start. The first premise (guy throwing the winning touchdown pass against a skillfully Catholic high school team, never seems to arrive over comb and then trying to unite the two teams again to play again) is one of the dumbest I've ever heard. Since Ron Shelton wrote much better sports movies, I wonder if there's more in it. I hope this film was not a dig at Shelton, whose name is a headline that says the story is like what's been written above. So we have the premise. And from there, one might think, or hope, that there might be a few twists and turns along the way to keep things lively. There is no such luck, sadly. This script follows every predictable stereotype you can possibly imagine. s not a single moment in this movie that you don't see coming miles before the movie unveils it and the ending.... so if you can't figure out the end at the end of the first reel then you haven't looked up or seen any other sports film in your life. Robin Williams and Kurt Russell star. Williams is the poor Schmo who dropped the big pass, and Russell is the quarterback who dropped the fateful pass. Gee, do you think Russell will just get up again and see if he and Williams can do something right that never got forgotten in the city? This is such a lame-duck comedy with a lame-duck scenario that you can only shake a head at what might have been. Sure, there are barbs and frankly there is quite a funny scene. Williams and Russell have marital problems and the wives invite them over for dinner to sort it all out. Neither of us realise you were invited on a Monday, and yes, Monday Night Football is on. Considering that both teams have been hit with only one victory, the men (Williams in particular) were trying to resist the temptation to find out how the play turned out. The scene gets to a couple of funny things when Williams checks the score by using a toilet as a trick. When he comes back, he coughs Russell the score. Later, when Russell begins to play his wife's moves, Williams switches the television on from another habitable space into her view. It's a really inspired, funny scene in a mostly uninspired, dull film."	1
"Another in a long series of clip clips, created by people who feel that it's worthwhile to use a camera as a story-telling tool. Within 15 minutes the entire premise is split into just a few lines, and there's simply no mystery that eliminates an entire facet of tension. The only semi competent actor is killed after ten minutes in the movie, leaving us silly characters that do stupid things. Low-budget movies can't afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portion is, unsurprisingly, unimpressive, but at least it was a valid attempt. The creature suit is horrible when it hangs on the pavement and the director repeatedly emphasises eyes that don't even feature red colours in mirror shots. The dialogue is cumbersome and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The final game sequence takes place in a police station, an escape from Terminator. Everybody hides in one of the glassy offices that Darkwolf klagen cannot penetrate. In the end the woman refers to the hero as a ""good protector,"" but he gets his partners, the original protectors and at least three other civilians, let alone a dozen police officers, killed without a chance to shoot the dog, despite an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun. Yet here the real wire to the novel: you could kill the beast right at the end of the credits if it was holding the stripper with its red eyes. Instead they took it into custody?! ?"	1
I can't believe so many people are comparing this movie with Argento's. His work is much more imaginative and devious - and more 醸️ enjoyable. The performer simply lacks the ability to create real excitement. The murder scenes - and let's face it, that's what the genre is about - are uninteresting. It wasn't hard to guess who the murderer was, and I didn't really care when it was revealed. The cinematography is not really memorable, and the much-vaunted 19th-century atmosphere hasn't really appealed to me. Some of the actors are pretty good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who rules the young students), but very little is given to them. True, there are undertones, such as incest, sadomasochism, and lesbianism, but in fact, surprisingly, there is little spice or tension. If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.	1
"LL Cool J did a lot better than I expected in this movie! He has done a fantastic job as a ""renegade"" cop in a ""breakaway"" division. Right from the start he manages to develop the viewer's understanding of his character and the predicament in which he finds himself. He acts as a sort of ""gentle giant"" - a man whose rugged exterior can scare anyone, but whose heart is clearly in the right place from the start - as excellent as possible. He was definitely the best character in the film. That was certainly an accomplishment that won't earn Morgan Freeman any awards. From starring in Powerhouse movies such as Shawshank Production, it was surely a step down. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true acting talent and he has unfortunately fallen back compared to this constellation of characters. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) might have played a more decisive role. That he didn't make it was disappointing and a real disappointment. I was hoping to see more of him in this film. Timberlake should have stayed in the music business. His portrayal of a young journalist was badly acted and unconvincing. This is an action film par excellence that - at least at first - bears a bit of a resemblance to the corrupt LA police practices of the past. As an action movie it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood and guts. These scenes are usually unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the film's opening scene, the tension is almost real in terms of what happens in the end -- a typical scenario of conflict between good and bad police -- and bears little resemblance to a real-life shoot-out between the police. I was annoyed with the way Timberlake's character behaved during the shoot. It begins to possess weapons rather than use them. And then, when it happened to a mission, he fires it off as if he've been firing a rifle all his life. Then he runs out of bullets and he doesn't have a weapon anymore - and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything - suddenly he has two fully loaded pistols AND additional ammunition?! Little plot mistakes like this really ruined the movie for me. If what you're looking for is a blatantly fictional storyline in a phantasmagoria in which all goes well for you, you're going to love this one. Personally, I don't care what kind of film it is, as long as it's realistic. Let me believe that the story is true. This story was obviously made up in so many ways that I was not satisfied."	1
"I want to make Holmes with Doors, but I can't string it all together. Oddly dirtier and overlapping Wonderland affords Kilmer a role that Morrison channels in equal measure... but how shy the movie is of the famous 14 inches! The Australian crime movie constantly listens in and leaves out the unnecessary violence... as one famous American actor says: ""Kiss a breast and it's an X, stab over and your action P13..."" WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long too long so in the end we all happily played the cinema again. How many films will we get called WONDERLAND? In the last decade, there have been six. The pixelated violence and muted colours set the deceptive tone, but the wobble camera grows exhausting as if we were staring all the time at her nostrils. A few tips from the driver and from the doors will be remembered the next day."	1
"I had terrible cliches, half the film was staffed with naked ""fallen angels"" ｗ (fallen angels) who moved around trying to behave scarily. Tom's character was terrible, terrible. And you have to love the lines they use. ""Is anyone out there, that's not funny,"" ""No, but that's what you did. I wish I could give that flick a 0! Oh, the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they have skipped Anthony, The Breakfast Club return to the forest with the unforgivable acting."	1
This assessment is based on my observations of an episode I watched last night (9 / 27 / 06). I don't think I'm going to look there. The acting was totally wooden, the plot entirely predictable and the ending totally unrealistic - who would pay $30m for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so unpleasant, nearly embarrassing in his role - maybe because he realised how bad the writing was! I know the drama shown this season is bad, but they certainly can find better writers. Perhaps they will outsource the contribution to India or China!! I bet we won't be seeing it again next season!	1
"You recognize the plot immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple seek to reunite their mother and father. Yes, it was the subject of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the scary thing. Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills during her role of the French-speaking daughter, Durbin, looking much older, as if she was in adulthood. And so are all their so-called brothers and sisters. And this confusion between adults and children runs through the film. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look all ridiculous while the director appears to have gone to great pains to promote his lavish tops and knickers throughout the film. So when you think that they are children or women, you're constantly torn. When Ray Milland and others begin to ""crack,"" you get the feeling they are pedophiles, and you could be yourself if you keep an eye on the spots and tops that the director has pointed out. Teens or seductresses, little girls or little foxes, one is never quite sure what to make of them. The parents appear very old too, and the whole film seems very old-fashioned. This is a rusty version of the parent trap and you should either avoid it, or at least respect it, if you don't believe me, make sure the tetanus recordings are up to date."	1
"I haven't heard a great deal about Planet Earth, the mini-series narrated in 2006 by my childhood idol David Attenborough. But whether they were watching down here in Australia or not, I never caught up and when I happened to see Earth (2007), a feature film compilation of the same pictures of nature, on the big screen, I made a joke of it. The theater was basically empty; only a second artist sat in the row before me, it was as if I had not only the big screen for me but the entire planet Earth. I was taken away for 90 minutes in the beauty and peril of the secretive wilderness - within some of the most beautiful living beings ever to be filmed. Impressive in scope and at times painfully intimate, ""Earth"" is filmmakers ""heartfelt appeal to recognize the delicate balance of life on our planet, and to understand how human invasion has brought countless beautiful animal and plant species to the brink of extinction. The film, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linalisis, is arguably striving for preservation in the wilderness, but, despite using propaganda to beat us on the head, the enigma of politics is completely ignored, with no one in view either. Instead, we simply embark on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of nature to witness the resilience and fragility of life on earth. I hear that this initial 15-episode mini-series delves far deeper into the scientific background of the world's ecosystems, but I think the filmmakers have made a smart decision to replace information with emotional, non-fiction information; I can't remember the last time I was so animated and completely broke. By creating an emotional link between the devotees and certain nördlich individuals, making them anthropomorphic to a certain degree, we can suddenly see the ""human side"" of each species and their desperate need for survival will turn into less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy. ""Earth Nothing Else"" appears fundamentally as a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it is the struggles of a polar bear trying to take her cubs to 虾arctic ice or the herd of vagabonds jostling towards the lifesaving seasonal flooding waters of the Okavango Delta. The documentary shows the delicate balance between life and death, which is emphasised in the desperate ballet of loot-loot interaction down-down. Although the recordings from time to time, perhaps to meet a ඳyounger audience, in the decisive Anzeige it is themselves break, I shed tears regularly at the inevitability of death and the unbridled instinct that makes those animals ""last hopeless attempts at survival. The hunt even highlights a stunning beauty: watching cheetahs prostrate their prey in slow motion, or seeing a great white shark bait an unfortunate sea lion in the majestic air. This weak balance has been fatally disturbed by the selfishness of our own species. Besides these main stories, tours are also staffed with wildlife from around the globe, including Papua New Guinea's birds of paradise and the autumn migration of the Sabine Crane. They could, of course, be given whole films, and one inevitable consequence of viewing many content is that some interesting ecosystems become unstable far too quickly. And, because filmmakers chose to focus more exactly Bremner's lifestyle on polar bear, elephant, and humpback whale using astonishing high-definition time-lapse photographs over the course of a calendar year, they were able to prevent any structural problems that might result from showing more than 90 minutes. As a result, ""Earth"" made me thirsty for more, and fortunately, a little over eleven hours more time provided I confront a copy of the DVD box set for ""Planet Earth."" With a harrowing, tearful, awe-inspiring and heartbreaking experience, Earth is a truly great documentary and perhaps my favourite film of 2007."	0
"This is the kind of film that Hollywood needs to make more of. No fancy props, no chases, no clever one-liners. Only people who have to deal with being human. William Macy plays the unlikely hitman who works for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy's is the dutiful son, Sutherland the dominant father. The son wants out of business, the father doesn't want him. Macy loves having his own son, beautifully played by David Dorfman (""The Ring invasion""). He also falls in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatric clinic. It's an interesting juxtaposition of characters, and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family. There are many touching scenes especially between Macy and his little boy. And a little humour comes into play, as you would expect from a film starring William Macy. Outstanding work by actor and director. Nice to know that it is possible to make a good movie in Hollywood on a low budget."	0
One of the most boring slasher movies ever, poorly performed and poorly written. MAP: Five students trying to stay at home during the holidays, trying to close a dormitory, but somebody has plans and begins killing one after another. Chief suspect: the gruesome groundsman John Hemmitt, played by Woody Roll, or one of the five characters of this series. Except for Daphne Zungia, who dies much too young and should have been the main heroine, and the rest all rather bland, neither is that good, although Laura Lapinski, bombast the lead heroine, may sometimes have her charm and end up feeling sorry for her. The KILLS just don't see why they banned it. Killings are mostly not real, one man has his hand cut in half early, which looks really wrong, but others are quite disgusting, as one girl gets hit by a car, one girl is boiled alive, and another is burned alive. OVERSEAS Not really a great slasher could have been much better	1
"Well done. As good as John Carpenter's outing was in Season 1 for ""Masters of Horror,"" this is the exact opposite. With ""Cigarette Burns"" he certainly proved that he still faces a scare, but ""Pro-Life"" is maybe the worst thing I know about him. It's daft, free of creepy atmosphere and tension, and all that remains is welcome leftovers, despite having a duration of less than an hour. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and unlikeable and the conclusion is beyond absurd. After all, for the ones who actually bought the DVD (one of them was me): Did you watch Carpenter describe it? As a matter of fact, he prides himself on it and talk about it as his best work in a long time and praise the script. And in the comment track in which he notices an obvious derogation that has made it all the way to the final cut, he simply says that he did not consider it essential to correct his error and just left it there. I am afraid that the old master has completely lost touch. I sincerely hope that I am proved right. At this point I would like to say in a positive way that the effects of living beings are fantastic. Technically, this film is first class, with effective light and make-up effects."	1
"This cowardly and offensive film inspired me. The characters here are mostly old-fashioned young men, hanging around in a small coastal town bored. Robert is an outsider, but he has his music which could have been his soul. Instead, Clay turns Robert into a freaks, embarking on a cannabis and ecstasy journey and going into the wrong amount. Clay seems to believe in the ""fridge craze,"" and Robert ends the movie as a murderous rapist. Part one. One wonders how much experience the young director has in real life. No one can save poor Robert. Clay's message is that young British men are out of control. There's a very strong link to the Iraqi insurgents - we are being bombarded by explosions and war images. The film shows how the extremism of male peer group members reaches its limits. The young London bombers draw a parallel with Tony's hateful depiction of modern men. Clay suggests that human beings cannot help themselves to commit horrible acts of violence. It is no wonder that the British film industry is investing money in films that advocate this divisive propaganda, while London continues to suffer the consequences of the recent attacks. This is Tony's first film, and I'd love to see it be his last."	1
This film is terrible. Acting is a basket. No crying, no plot, no hopeless songs. Although the scenery is great. I always wanted to go to Greece. Anyway, you expected a great performance against Saif, but even he let people down. Akshay Kumar, reputed as Bollywood's pin-up and voice of singing. He was a sensation in that movie. For that alone Filmfare should be awarded another prize. The toilets awarded the worst performance. The trophy should be a toilet seat. Kareena Kapoor. First of all she is not to be compared with her sister Karisma. In action, appearance, or body. She now wants to prove she can overtake them. She appears in the movie in bikinis and a tank top and shorts. I do wonder why Saif Ali Khan is so attracted to his future wife. But it must have impressed some who dress in that way. And if you ask how, keep in mind that every man has every erection and is going to watch this film. They dream of Kareena Kapoor naked in bed with a condom. Including me. Personally I think she was dressed like a whore but I really enjoyed that. I have to give 1 / 10 to his one, but this movie I would give 0 / 10. An unrivalled film.	1
Whether it's rain or sunshine outside, you enter a cinema. It makes you happy. (If not, come out immediately.) Lights out. You settle down with a bar of ice cream.

You sit at the campfire... take up the modern version überzeugt der kullegende Flamefetisch 24 x per second and share the joy of exploring the silent twists and turns of this scenery with the rest of your kindly and with the spectators. If you are not happy with yourself, don't write comments. (Long live the romantic comedy...)	0
"I haven't seen ""Henry Fool"" yet, but having seen ""Fay Grim,"" I am not sure if I want it at all. Perhaps Hartley wants to become an ""anti-thriller director"" - surely with the yawning he has managed to do so. Based on the official account of the woman discovering that her dead husband's manuscript contained material that could pose a national security threat, I expected a tighter geopolitical drama. İ Instead, I got flimsy structure, gritty dialogue, sultry characterisations, tangled plot strands and a tone that changes so often that one imagined Hartley had altered the script at all times to suit his mood. I can get stuck for a long time with a frustrating, difficult plot (e.g. ""Duplication of fingerprints"") Because I reckon that the two limbs will eventually split. Even if they won't or won't, but they still leave some questions aside (e.g. ""Duplicity""), keen writing and action can keep interest going. But halfway through ""Fay Grim,"" I came to a lethal realization - I didn't know what was going on and didn't care. Too bad, because I like Parker Posey, who is reduced to working with the absurd part in turning us from indifferent estranged wife and indifferent, clueless mother into a tough, clever international ""gamer"" capable of dealing with a man with terrorists psychologically. There is also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum may be very good, but as a CIA operative he is not able to overcome misunderstandings. He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I have watched him. Worse, his CIA sideline is invoked: like a fugitive from the quarterfinals of ""American Idol"" (are there really young CIA agents with large hair draped cleverly over their foreheads? trag). Then there's the futile question of the age of the characters. Goldblum was 54 when he made ""Fay Grim""; Thomas Jay Ryan, who played ""Henry Fool,"" was 44. None have been made to look, or act, older than their true age. But a crucial point in history is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua as early as the ""1970"" s. Goldblum's character would have been in his early twenties, Henry Fool a teenager. Was Hartley ""quirky"" or lazy? The problems are too numerous to list..."	1
"I'm a Christian... and I find this film awful. No-one will like the film except for hard, biblical Christians. The message is just too direct in your face. If we want to reach a wider audience, we have to be more subtle. There is no way that Dad would be wagging the Bible and carrying it with him in EACH Scene. RIDICULOUS! Bad direction. The news of the missing was supposed to be awful, but it was ridiculous. Leaving their dresses on the floor? The song reminded me of old Ed Wood films: ""Oh my God! People are missing! "" This scene on the plane is just stupid. Just remember, when you found your relative's clothing next to you you wouldn't be screaming, ""Oh my goodness."" They disappeared! You're missing! ' and start to cry and scream. At first, you would be in denial... except you would not rush into that conclusion. See Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favourite picture is the dog, sitting in the grass outside with a pile of clothes and boots beside him. I fell off the couch, laughing so loudly. The music was so bad and so distracting. It was as if the composer were in his own world, as if he were setting to music his own films. ""This is my chance to make a thriller, and this is my chance to make action!"" Stop telling me how JAMES COVELL feels A good touch supported what happened on the screen... This film needed more BUT, but that was as much in the face as the message. The writing was bland. The same was true of Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea were worse: ""You don't understand! People are missing!. "" Brad Johnson could laugh. The two outstanding performances came from 猛 antichrist and elder (I'm sorry, I don't remember their names) when they looked at ""Making of"" (in response to my question: ""What did they think?? ""), producers, filmmakers and actors are only fooled, saying;"" we're going to reach a big audience ""and"" Brad Johnson's the hero ""and"" this is like a Hollywood film. "" I have come to the conclusion that they just do not know what they are doing. I commend the effort. Getting the message across to the wider audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best possible medium to do that. Make movies like WHITE AWAKE, SAFE, CONTACT, PASSION OF Christ, even O'BROTHER WHERE ART YOU? The bottom line was that people with talent and vision needed to make the film. Sadly, it wasn't."	1
A wonderfully whimsical film with enough twists and turns for a pretzel. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be, as she seems. The story is very tongue in cheek, and the dialogue skillfully under-done. References to humor and intrigue, both of which don't quite fit Posey's characterization. The supporting cast is excellent. The downside? This film requires your full attention to a point where you have to stop the movie and take notes. Posey has more sex appeal in raising an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire bodies. s worth it even if you do not understand the titles.	0
I suspect any novel with as many downers as Moby Dick, wouldn't have gone down well with the public, who have had enough of their own problems. Yet any similarity to Herman Melville's classic is pure chance. In fact, half the movie is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not too much of it has been preserved for the film. First we meet Ahab Creely (he has a surname and a brother), a happy two-legged soul and the wish to marry Joan Bennett, Father Map's daughter. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is an Ahab with a exaggerated performance. Barrymore had a not-entirely-mastered touch to the tone of cinema, and there was rie history of mute times, plus a stage voice that would have made each cinema hall in which the movie had to come to life. We see Ahab lose his leg to the whale Moby Dick, and I must say the scene of the amputation was pretty horrendous. Of course, everything was before the Code. But I'm sure spectators shivered. After that, the narrative of Ahab's hunt for that whale was incomplete to him, which in his opinion was unsightly in Joan Bennett's eyes. That may not be Melville's motivation; in fact, there are no female characters in Moby Dick, as he wrote. One of the things Melville did was to provide personalities to the crew of Ahab's ship Pequod. Unlike Queequeg, the cannibal harpooner, it remains with the names, but not with the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might just as well be Smith and Jones. I'd watch this version of Moby Dick only out of curiosity and nothing else.	1
"I have criticized that film with the statement: ""When you can come over the moralization..."" That is totally missed. Moralising oneself is, so to speak, in the conscience of the beholder. This is a decent moviegoing with a normal thriller, but with a distinct twist, which turns up halfway through the final part. But the purpose of this is to make viewers think: ""What would I do in that position?"" And I must believe that that was exactly what the filmmaker intended. The film succeeds exclusively in achieving this and with it the end of the entertainment of the audience. I also like the way the violence is never shown on stage, only off camera. We know what's just happened, it's not being served in front of us and then rubbed into our faces like modern blood and women's tissues. It isn't about violence. The point is the immoral dilemma the protagonist tackles adroitly, albeit disturbingly."	0
One of the worst films I have seen sloppy cinematography, crappy filtration, movie was grainy, script was terrible, I guess come on, how predictable was the fight at the wrong time..... some of the fight scenes were ok... some scenes were so funny... how Sorbo ended up getting the horse and riding it... LOL I truly mean.. a horse? t forget, how the perpetrators of this crime roll in the same vehicle through the movie... one would think that after killing the chief witnesses and federal agents, they would be calm and found straight away...	1
I remember a lot of kids were crazy about it. I was probably a little too old to put my hands on things and I was a fan of real martial arts films and always thought it was handelsy. rechtlich in the early '90s, we were inundated with programs such as this that make the children feel as though they could crash and be a sort of power ranger or animator on 3 ninjas. I think at times parents and filmmakers have had enough of it, because in reality, we just had a dull impression of young Frankfurt, who beat and beat everybody. Many children's movies have a big point they're trying to do and it's great that your kids are watching and getting the message, it's gotten no message whatsoever... it's just a million different things in less than 90 minutes. The film lacks great visual quality, but would you expect that? The acting is, after all, pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor, but it was embarrassing to see him here. The short, thick, puffed-up fart with the feathery eyes as a powerful ninja was simply fun. The children usually acted way too hard and the youngest Ninja Tum brochen was perhaps the worst child actor I have ever seen. The film has a plot everyone knows before they've even read the review. 3 Ninjas... yes, they're going to fight some bad guys and win... I have to say more. Sorry I was spoiled with it. With all that talking up, kids will love it. This film is for children, and only kids could enjoy it. If you don't mind kids watching films about kids struggling with depression, that is a good movie to see. If you don't mind if your kids see all the rubbish, that has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or real time then you've found a film for your kids... I say children because I think even the girls will love it... I remember all the girls falling in love with Rocky. 2 out of 10 stars, because I think that you can make a film for kids and still make it entertaining for adults... this movie failed then and again. Kung Fu is the TV show on DVD and there are lots of great Shaw Brothers movies these days... Why not teach your kids things that really entertain and never run those kids crazy, maybe you even teach them a few steps, and not just how Grandpa kicked them on 3 ninjas between their legs... no no no no... never kick a man under the legs... never... this is unninja like.	1
"I wish I could give this film a zero or even less, because that's what it deserves. I honestly never leave a movie, but this one was so terrible I couldn't stand a minute of it. Please, please, please, leave out this film out of philanthropy. If you want a hot lesbian film that you can dive into, that wasn't it. It has unattractive, unappealing leads, choppy structure, ridiculous dialogue and absolutely no convincing in any way. On a very basic level, she is no entertainer. Everything about ""Mango Kiss"" is so theatrical, it's more than any student movie I've seen. And if that was not enough, it relies on constant - and, I mean constant - voices in verbands throughout the entire film. The screenwriter might as well have written a novel because she insisted on sharing whatever she was reading, instead of showing it. Let us assume that Lou and Sassafras are best friends and have a specific connection even though there is no character development. And the film continues to present new characters after the first five minutes - not in a natural way ＆ but in a still image of the characters of the story whose names were written across the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters. In fact, we aren't getting to know any of them. This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen. I am gay, and watching this movie along with my roommate (another gay woman), and we both found this film depressing for the portrayal of queer cinema. I start to think that lesbian and gay films are similar to the Christian rock -- no matter how disgusting it may be, people will still flock to that and campaign for it, no matter how bad the quality. Please do not rent!! We should instead encourage the production of quality gay-lesbian films by renting ""But I'm a Cheerleader,"" or ""Fire"" or ""Heavenly Creatures,"" rather than swallowing any mindless tripe directed at the gay community. Queer as Folk)."	1
"This film is too long, far too repetitive, male nudity and sexuality (as alleged as a gay man in my own collection of grown-up titles) are too futile and unnecessary. The first third of the film could have been cut to about ten minutes, and might have been as effective without testing the patience (and stamina) of the audience. I met an audience in an early Saturday afternoon at a festival with a tendency to be more adventurous and more interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as short films without much dialogue, short films or foreign work. Nearly sold-out audiences at a theater with about 275 seats already began flexing in the first half of the film, and while the vast majority stayed because of the ""supplementary payment"" (that's never got there), in my 14 years of participating in any number of film festivals, I've never seen so many people get caught out by a film. This film could easily have been reduced by more than half and would have been just as effective. It could have gone in different directions, but with shorter durations and more effective consequences. As it currently stands, it is not something that one can recommend with ease or that one might like to revisit."	1
"Roy Rogers plays Jesse James and his gambler-turned-gambler partner Clint Burns. George ""Gabby"" Hayes is Mr. Rogers's ex-boyfriend, Sheriff Gabby. A strong team includes Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan), two reporters looking for stories about the elusive outlaw hero. Of course, the fake identity / imitation is a murder story since Rogers is doing a ""double role."" Rogers prefers to be charming, as always, but there's nothing really that takes his performance above and beyond the usual - any way of delivering a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is going to get you an absolute treat. The better couple are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye, who cover the St. Louis Journal as contributors - they form the highlight of the film.

"I picked this up at the video shop because Tarantino recommended (""If you choose (this) I'd like to f * * * myself!"") on the box... seemed like a praising song to ring.... I was expecting a bit more like ""Death Proof..."" not much actual violence in that one tho, the plot, character or dialogue. Look at the poster. It's all there. Stunts and rock. It goes back and forth. It's tes about a week in the life of an LA band with a wacky magical to-do experiment you'd experience in one of the Strips ""smaller casinos, and an Australian stuntman new to the city. They work, they meet girls, they party. End of story. The band obviously needed all these things, 敢, because they are frankly second rate and play a style that was outdated as early as 1978. It has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are very sadistic - this Aussie guy is 约 really special, and the film appears to be motivated largely by love and respect for the ""art"". I just hung on to see what he was going to do next. I wish he'd found a better vehicle."	1
I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews on the Internet. I thought Cinderella 2 (and 3) is a very sweet and funny sequel for everyone - children and adults... like me I am 22 years old. I also find it a very informative film, showing no teachings on how to be true to yourself and follow heart and heart. I found her foolhardy, and the casting for the voice was very good, even the songs sung by Brooke Allison. Since this film is split into three flashbacks, my favourite of the three is the tale of Jaq the mouse becoming human for a leisurely day thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic.	0

"Another insult and slap in the face to gay people around the world. This lame attempt at comedy has no counterpart. Yet again we have an attractive, ""straight"" hero who possibly can't persuade a woman to take an interest in him. Yes, right! And we also have in front of some people a ""sympathetic, attractive"" gay friend who is a fat, bald, ugly old man, whom the leadership regards as attractive. Not even I found him attractive, and I'm a fat, ugly old gay man (and luckily not bald). Whatever good is found in acting, it's been dumped on an evil script and truly awful directing. You should ban Mr. Sneedeker from the film business, but he's no different from the myriad other hacks working in Hollyweed."	1
"I showed it to my sixth grade about 17 years ago, and the students loved it. I loved it, too. The history of termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. The cast is deep, and they all play their roles superbly. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic footage. Alan Root did some 100 per cent cinematography that should have been rewarded with the Oscar for best documentary. The copy I have hasn't got Orson Welles telling it (Derek Jacobi) and it's not ""Mysterious Castles of Clay,"" but ""Castles of Clay."" That leads me to believe that Welles must have been just as much about star power and Oscar buzz. Recently I was very lucky to find these VHS's and now it is my kid's personal favourite film. They brought it instead of a Disney movie to the most recent family reunion. Whoever finds this movie is in luck."	0
What a snoring feast. Of all the bits of nostalgia Hollywood has decided to overhaul and update, this is by far the most pointless. This was a totally pointless show from the word go and we don't REALLY need a 'modern' update of it. It's all about the bigotry and sexism that's inherent in the system right from the beginning, but there's been so much progress since that show that the whole premise of the show, if it had any, was lost. Besides, what's the point of having a character called Boss Hogg, if he's not overweight?	1
"Let's be honest? Al Gore is no more concerned with the environment than most people are with overstating the importance of the foot. It's a catch! No doubt: Al Gore is a POLITIZER! Three years ago he was ticketing in his home state doing 70mph in a 55mph zone driving not a hybrid, a crossover, or even a GM subway, but a LINCOLN (go goofing if you want)! Or how about allowing Mr. Gore and his Hollywood pals to continue using fuel-guzzling private jets to go to premieres of ""An Inconvenient Truth""? So much for the environment, huh, Al? In any case, it takes a minute to subjectively examine ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and discover the einheit's biggest fundamental error. Though the film gives many seemingly impressive scientists a chance to explain to voters the EFFICTS of supposed ""global warming,"" not a single scientist tells us what potential explanation they have. Let me give you an example: I can hug a hundred people and point out a parked car that is not driving correctly. But can you say with any degree of certainty why? Not at all! secondly, how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented then)? What did they have, a June delivery in a mattbox? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? How, then, can you know with any certainty that the planet is ""warmer,"" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is the only cause? The answer is: We don't know and science is NEVER a consensus. Thirty years ago a Time Magazine cover proclaimed a ""new ice age."" In fact, any sixth-grade science teacher who knows Earth science will tell you that volcano eruptions, solar activity, and El Ninos have more to do with our complete extinction of climate change than supposed ""global warming."" But what Al Gore fails to punish adequately is this: Even if America decides to do what he calls to everything in the global gospel, how can we make the rest of the world follow suit, when we can't even get them to express agreement on something as self-evident as terrorism? Answer: It's wishful thinking Mr. Gore & you, the former VP of the United States, know it. If these makers of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" were gravely honest, they would have given their film the title ""Al Gore Wants Attention."" But what I really would like would be for the former VP to ask this: Why were two of the 1,500 respondents in the area, China & India, not in the Kyoto agreement? Anyway, I'm told A.I.T's producers are working on their next movie, ""Gnomes, gehörigkeit & Elven: Our Endangered Friends."""	1
This film is a complete waste of time, the plot horrific, the dialogue awful. Acting is OK, but the actors have absolutely no plot or screenplay to work on. Also the photo and some special effects, but again there is nothing interesting to be seen in this film. There is no logical sequel to the story, the story is complete nonsense. It's not even scary. In order for a film to be eerie, at least a small element of credibility is required. This film has lost all credibility. There are only three characters in the film. Each figure is flat and has no personality. Also, most special effects and make-up work poorly or mediocre at best. I hope you read this and don't waste time on this film unless you're curiously inquisitive to see a truly awful film.	1
And it doesn't help Rohmer's argument that Syberberg came a few years later and (with a little help from Wagner) created this work of his own remarkably well. Perhaps this film did not look that paltry at its release, without the Syberberg film, which probably was shot in an even smaller sound room with smaller resources. Whether there are horses in the Syberberg film, I don't know yet. All I know is that this looks like a film-based college production when it comes to being archived. ... it doesn't even get mentioned on IMDb here... yet some kind of film's there on '12th and 14th Centuries' or something like that... well, that's not very useful for the film. It seems inauthentic and cheesy, comme le pimmage mon cher!!! Crohmer is one of those French writers who shows his leading men how unattractive they are too, and that is unhelpful. Syberberg's Parsifal was lovable and can be seen today on German TV selling what he called an invented bicycle. ... I shiver at the thought of what it is like to see the modern man on video. The last time I saw the film in a cinema, I remember being so in shock that it was a five-and-a-half-hour-long travesty. But even then, I fear, you would have to outdo what this version has to offer. Points for seriousness, for chutzpah, but... this film would have just needed more money. It doesn't look like a mediaeval manuscript, but CHEAPO! BON MARCHE!! Oh, and yes, it ends, quite randomly, with Parsifal going to church inside that cheesy Passion Play... bla!	1
"ve watched some years before on a now-defunct Sicilian TV channel ι surprisingly it has turned out to be a hefty DVD made by Criterion: since I wasn't sure at first what I had made of it (although it had attained cult status over the years, it is clearly seen with modesty even by fan of the genre) I decided not to buy it, as I did for a similar and to me unknown FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958). Recently I managed to buy THE BLOB on Netanjaha Spanish DVD which, interestingly, ported from the Criteri32 ""s"" Specials ""to the two Audio Commentary tracks, but unfortunately I could not switch off the Spanish subtitles while I was playing the main 鷽! Anyway, seeking the movie again, I was surprised at how much fun it was for me (despite some of the narrative fissures I may later mention) - as a pure example of ""B-movie"" ageism (uncharacteristically colored) and as a time capsule that illustrated social attitudes in the late 1950s. The male lead role was an early feature for McQueen. While the actor may have regarded her with contempt afterward, his only contribution to the genre turns out to be very appeal: he is not averse to youthful kicks, but, fundamentally, he is a decent (and above all altruistic) child. The special effects depicting the slimy, expanding creature are not poor by their type and epoch; the film itself climaxes well, beginning with the Monster's invasion of a cinema (which was being screened at the opening of a satirical Italian TV show called Blob, as I mentioned in the film's recent script entry, but which was curiously ""filmed""!). To the admittedly small quibbles from the film: the animal is not shown along the way, it just appears at various locations and is not seen by anybody! ; it is an astounding over-emphasis (tantamount to padding) of the kids' sideburns by the police; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot the block as though bullets will destroy a liquid, whatever proportion it counts! It is also absurd that the young make the residents of the city aware of the dangers by calling them to their doorsteps (especially considering that at that time only McQueen had seen the monster in action)! In 1972, an inferior follow-up entitled BEWARE THE BLOB was released. The original was built in 1988 - I had a good look at that many years ago - but it didn't seem to have made a lasting impression on me (though I know Michbombing Elliott's nächster Musik loves it). Remember: I'll cover this film with two other collateral plans between director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris: 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960)."	0
There can be no question marks over this film but the director has punched us and sullied the film in so many ways. This film, a crass rip-off that works like critters and gremlins, fails on so many levels to capture the humor and horror of these better-advised movies again. In the end, it is just a flimsy waste of time, with bad actors providing bad dialogue before a silly director occasionally throws plush ones at them. They wrestl with these toys tolling the same way as in the old Tarzan movies - when rubber crocodiles were used - shake them as they scream, and try their best to make them look slightly menacing. It's painful to watch and not much fun to watch the spiritual Eighぽfashion that actresses are wearing. With any luck, a couple of crazy little aliens imprisoned in a piece of film by an ageing security man are released, then, after decades in custody, start retooling with people's minds on their telepathy. The new guard recruit verkauf, the moron who allowed them to fly out despite repeated warnings, collects his friends from the eighties and they go out together and make little adventures in an attempt to catch their Grema... Hobgoblins. It's all life with the gang, Flasche, the 80-year-old's girlfriend, the hero's grumpy girlfriend and the youthful hero who has zero self-confidence and wishes mutlich 5.1 to go. First, the infamous scene of the rake struggle in which the ex-soldier narrates his training to be a bully in the army, where he spends hours on end picking out the nerdy hero with the wrong end of the rake. Then he runs about and ends in a full-on cake fight that ends in a frenzied nightclub with comedic hand grenades blowing everything up, except the very people standing right beside them. Then the series ends and it ends happily. But it isn't. It's like watching a train crash, you can't make it, it's so sick. Perfect food for mystery science theatre, but thankfully terrible when you are trying to see it alone and uncut. The police are still pursuing several outstanding warrants against the marshals and I dare not trust anybody to laugh at the rake-fight. This is not more than 6 points out of 10 on a good day.	1
here's a perfect example of something really bad happening... can I recommend someone to watch it? Well, it kind of kept me busy to be oncologists in this campaign (I still don't wanna see him winning).. and I stayed only to the end because the director was there for a bit of research... but that wasn't done very interestingly.. what's it about? The first half (the worth seeing) presents three characters: a hooker, a musician and some sort of official.. the first two lie about other professions.. the third is Ω and aufgeführt, the real liar.. the second half (do something else.. spoil not to let yourself have a good evening) includes a few old breasts and violent alcohol... but perhaps you'll see it differently... the old jury has done it (did they drink vodka?	1
"I suspect that it was for Temple Matthews, who actually wrote a remake -- though there are only a few alterations that make things worse. SPOILERS: It's very similar to the original. Melody, Ariel's new daughter, is threatened by Urban's sister Morgana. Morgana escapes, but keeps her promise to take Melody away. Did Ursula have a sister?! And she's not as big a villain as Ursula. There are similarities here. Medoly is kept away from the sea until Morgana is captured but she does not know anything yet because it all happened when she was a baby. A wall surrounds the palace to keep them in and out. She goes under the wall every day to have a bath and talk to Sebastian who's not as funny or funny as he is at the stadium. She finds a shellfish with her name on it and runs away from home to search for answers in Morgana. This is the resemblance; Morgana tricks Melody and happy her by transforming herself into a mermaid. Eric, Melody and King Triton are searching for her. To be a mermaid, she must steal the Trident from Triton. So Melody just doesn't know that King Triton is her father. She makes friends with a penguin and a walrus, and here it is terrible. The penguins that live in the icy ocean with them hate them because they're cowards. So they try to prove they're heroes and fail. This is not for the little mermaid. And the dialogue between the penguins and these two characters in these conversations is deafening. You know why? Because the first one had a great story. It's not magical and it's not magical. It's just one example of how bad sequels are. Melody finds her and she helps her bring her to Atlantica to prove herself. As they take the trident, Ariel finds tunes for Morgana. Melody is furious with her mother for keeping her away from the sea, so she gives Morganobstacles the trident and immediately shows her true face when she grabs it. Ariel and Melody are in her care. The penguin and walrus begin to prove themselves as they battle Morgan's shark friend. Sorry I didn't mention it. They are finally proving themselves. Eric, King Triton and his soldiers arrive, but they are forced to bow down before Morgana by the power of Trident. Melody grabs, throws it at Triton and he parries Morgana (literally). Ariel then apologises to Melody and thinks she is herself to blame. It wasn't! Ariel has done the right thing to protect Melody but they never say that. Triton offers a great 設 tuneî to live on land or by sea. She even has a 'better idea'. With the Trident, she evaporates the wall, so that man and beast can be together. So everyone sings a horrible song. The end. Anyone who has seen it and who likes it has obviously not seen the original. I don't like it because I'm a teenager. I liked it when I was very young. As I got older, I realised what was wrong with that film. Young, young children will enjoy it, but they may forget it at primary school. I'd usually say I exaggerated a movie, and it was better than I remember afterwards when I watched the film again, but not this one. It's worse. History is no exception. If you thought that if you read this story that the story is good, read more of that comment, and you will also know the other bad points: Well, you know porn by now. I'm sorry I spoiled it for you but I had to point out some bad parts of it. One of the worst things is the animation. Color is horrible. The original had a nice color. Watching this has almost made me blind. The illustrations and landscaping were also not good. The original is gorgeous, adorning in colors and wonderfully interwoven in seawater landscapes and landscapes and makes it a pleasure to watch. The music is unbearable. Compared to the first two, the music here is crap. The songs are not well composed and Tara Strong (I guess that's her name) who couldn't sing Melody couldn't sing. She sometimes sang too high or did not stick to the tune of the song. So much for ""Melody."" And the music is anything but beautiful or moving. The Little Mermaid 1 has won an Oscar and she deserves it. It would have earned the rattle prize for the worst score in a sequel, if it existed. I didn't like the voices. Several players who had played for Everton in the first years did the same. Jodi Benson is a great singer, but now that she's older no-one resents her, her voice is way too deep and not so beautiful. And I'm really disappointed in her and everybody else who attended for the first time. If I were chosen for this film by simply reading the script, I'd say it was a bad film. Today the characters are different. Ariel is now smarter but more annoying. Her figure was exaggerated, which made her too mature. In sequels, character change is not provided unless there is a specific reason. In the first she was sixteen. There is little chance that it will change. At this stage, you are the person you will be for the rest of your life. Screenwriters should remember this. You should think about the character. Well, I suppose that's it for me. I hope that you feel my comments are useful, because I am sure a large number of you will agree with me."	1
"Great film - especially the music - Etta James - ""Finally."" That speaks volumes when you finally find that particular person."	1
"I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least the performances of BRITTANY SNOW and IDRIS EL were good, but some of the teens were not completely convincing as ""Lead Friends"" at the prom. The killer was so stupid and he looked so stupid. The dead were stupid, boring and unoriginal. The film was also very boring and very over-rated. It was not exciting at all, I almost fall asleep. It's another negative PG-13 remake, a really horrible movie. The ending was so silly and the climax was so rushed and boring. The movie is also quite slow. On the whole the only positive thing maybe about this shit festival is that BRITTANY SNOW I think she had a good performance and also IDRIS ELBA, but other than this this was a completely terrible film and an awful remake. That is my opinion. I gave it a 2 / 10."	1
It is a wonderful film that makes the 1950s look really stylish. Kim Novak is fascinating and compelling as a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in Endless. The supporting cast is all sublime, from Jack Lemmon as her consolation Ereignis villain Nicky, to Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico who works on Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the slight, happy Aunt Queenie. Then there's the cat, of whom I have no idea how many witches (outside of myself) have called Pyewacket but suspected a fool. Jon Stewart appears out of place, but neither does his character in this enigmatic subworld of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And there's a perfect romantic happy end to this film - which we believe in because these kinds of films also have a happy ending. Gillian and Shep have exactly the same chance to be happy as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen, which is also a great film.	0
"I liked how it began with some decent special effects, especially for a film that's 50 years old. There were some pretty impressive backdrops. However, the film bows down fairly early on to some very dimmable dialogue, when the men all try to flirt with Anne Francis ""ਨ"" Altaira Morbius.) When we went to see the magazine in the nineties after a long absence, it was nice to see Francis again, an actress who has mainly made TV programmes since that movie and still works in the field of acting. It was also interesting to see a young looking Leslie Nielsen (""Dr. John J. Adams""), whom I wouldn't have recognised if I hadn't watched half this film before the boredom blossomed to almost giants, and I was looking for the worst. I appreciated their re-playing of that VHS tape in stereo. But it was a poor attempt. This is one of those overrated films of Breitenbach in which ""elites"" claim to be ""hard"" and ""thought provoking."" This is nonsense. It was only considered ""intelligent"" because the rest of the sci-fi movies of the 50s were so stupid!! Some if the first scenes looked good on my widescreen, something I didn't have at the time at writing. Perhaps another joke about the 2.35-to-1 widescreen broadcast would prompt me to alter this test."	1
"Despite the film's terrific forward direction, astute Asimov premise, and Will Smith's reliably cool performance, the film falls short of expectations. The cliches are thick and fast (the cop is 店 cop out of a nightmare by the rushed-to-task senior lieutenant, and listing more would have corrupted him - you can see the end a stone's throw away). This film is full in phases, too - you never have the feeling of travelling anywhere; what's supposed to be a global disaster, never quite leaves a CGI Chicago photo. The robots themselves are good in close-ups, but the ""crowd"" scenes look more like bad Disney - the CGI is always exaggerated. And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them up, why are they still gagging for ngans? You know it's a crazy movie when stupid questions like this bother you before climax. It might have been great, but it's less than the sum of his parts, predominantly due to the totally predictable plot that could have come from an action film from the past 40 years."	1
"Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Directed by Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin And the beginning of that is actually George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn kicked off filming the sequel, Lucio Fulci decided to call it Zombie 2. This movie is the one we know to be a plain zombie. You know the one where the zombie fights the shark! So after that movie (called Zombie 2 in Italy) came out, made a hell of a lot of money, the Italians decided damn it up. Let's go for some more zombie glitches! These things rake the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Still confused? The story about this movie is really merely a synthesis of stories we have seen in many American ZToo movies. The opposing film may compare the Return of the Living Dead, surely the best comparison of this is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see... there's the government conducting experiments with a certain poison gas, which turns people into zombies. Canisters will shebang in the general population and! We get lots of zombies craving human flesh. A group of people run away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. You have to fight the zombies to survive. There was a lot of trouble during the shooting. In particular, the beloved godfather of the Italian Gore, Lucio Fulci, was sick. That's why he couldn't end this movie the way he wanted. The film then went to two commanders, Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to jazz up a film that was already not as good. One can see that Fulci himself had not really connected his life and soul with this film. He was disillusioned. He gave the field to the producers and basically he said, ""Do what the hell you guys want with it."" And God loved her. And that's why we have such a crappy zombie movie with The Great Fulci as its ""leader."" In my opinion, the main problem is that the well is just so useless! There is no substance at all! After the opening few minutes in which a handful of terrorists steal the poison gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the film leaves a Amazonian pile of empty, soulless characters with no personality managing to evade the zombies. Now, this could be funny in some cases when the zombie makeup # 1 is pretty good and witty and # 2 has a lot of courage. We will get neither! There are some inspiring moments here, such as when some eagles infect themselves with the gas and start attacking people. That was cool. There's also a scene around a flying zombie's head (which defies logic and explanation, by the way), and a scene in which zitze come out of the pool of the abandoned hotel Brandenburgers and bite the legs off a poor girl. But then... the rest of the flashback just goes flat on my butt. There are endless scenes that do not help to take the plot, which is already non-existent. That was my main problem with the clip. The scenery still looks unfinished and there is practically no artistic direction. I hate it when it all looks so damn unfinished! I like my B movies, but this one has really gone further! is nearer to the Z-level moves in case you ask me. The zombie mask? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the film was shot in the Philippines), which means you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But that is not a major problem, because her film sequences take place in the Philippines anyway. It's the look of the zombies that really suck! For some reason they all died wearing the same clothes. And what is used here as zombie NBC make-up is a pile of black makeup (more like spots) on the faces. One or two were slightly more complex, but they still failed to impress. It's just a bunch of frills that meaninglessly thump on the faces of the actors. The film is not only slow, the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead people! Anyway, you don't expect the usual cool from a relegation battler, because this is about someone else's flash mobs, in a sense. And the two parties involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't really put their heart and soul into it. In fact, when you watch the extras, you see that Fragasso is not even serious when you ask him about his memories and feelings about the movie. You could tell he was ashamed, and on many occasions he said they ""only had to do one job and they did it."" And my friends, that's the final nail on the iPod. There is no love and no heart for this film. Thus you get a half-naked, crappy zombie fuck. Just for people who want to have all of zombie fucks. But anyone else, don't even care!

I walked into the film knowing it wasn't going to be good. But what I witnessed was too frightening for words. I don't mean to be harsh because the film was horrible. informieren Sie sind sehr bad, I mean abysmal special effects, the acting wasn't bad either, but wooff he wasn't and sasquatch itself was something like... well, not a sasquatch. I think the best prank movie is Harry and the Hendersons. It's not violent or horrific, but it has the best representation of sasquatch. After all, it's a suit, not a half-hearted cgi rip-off. to only see this movie when one is desperate or truly appreciates someone in the movie. Or you watch a Sanctuary on TV, which is far better?	1
"Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is an upper-middle-class housewife living in a suburban private home with her twin children and abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della devotes all of her attention to the twins, neglecting their home and their exterior, unsettling Kenneth. On Christmas Eve she makes a drive to the shopping centre at night to buy wrapping paper ズ, and she does not have a parking lot. When she parked an old car at two spots, she left a message for the owner who called her a ""selfish jerk."" When the mall closes, Della's car is stopped by the driver of the old car and she's being threatened by four punks - Chuckie (Lukas Haas), an African-American named 'Tick' (Jamie Starr), a Chinese-American named 'Vingh' (Leonard Wu) and a Latin American named 'Tomás' (Luis Chavez). As the safety guard at the shopping centre protects her, Chuckie shoots him in the head, while Della speeds up her car as she tries to escape from the criminals. Nevertheless her truck crashed near a wood while she was being pursued by the gang. She picks up the tool kit, hides in the woods and fights the gang to survive. I saw the trailer for ""While She Was Out"" a couple of days ago and I was eager to see the DVD. Unfortunately the trailer is better than the film, and I am completely disappointed by this boring and implausible collection of cliches. Della Myers is depicted as an insecure and neglected housewife and inexistent as a wife; motherhood is her only interest in terms of the family. She is pursued by four wicked thugs, but she defeats them with a toolbox which doubles as a pool robe. The plot is therefore so absurd that it is irritating. The Guangzhou Legion of Honor criminal gang is rooted in a typical stereotype of American movies in which an African-American, Chinese and Latino man and an American man appear to be politically correct. Kim Basinger may have a decent acting career, but her children are immature for a woman of 55. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): ""Enquanto Ela Está Fora"" (""When She Was Out"")"	1
I was very excited to see that they had even made a film out of my favourite book. I didn't realise it was Disney until it was too late. I was appalled at the many failures of important parts of history. It was as if someone videotaped a fourth-grader's account of the novel. Meg did well at school, and neither her nor her father wore spectacles. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was portrayed as a scientist, omitted her kitchen lab and replaced it with the internet. And this is just the beginning. During the middle of the film, I had shouted at the screen, much to the horror of the other people who watched the film, who had not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs up than four thumbs down for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for somebody who hasn't read this book, this movie is kind of OK.	1
"I have not read any biography of Lincoln, so maybe this was a true account... and perhaps it is because I am used to the equally alienating and unrealistic depictions of adoration that Lincoln unnaturally characterizes as brilliant, honorable and the savior of our country.... But why should they make a movie portraying Lincoln as a moron? While Henry Fonda did a splendid Lincoln, his description as ""aw shucks, I'm just a simple guy"" was lightly insulting. [Admittedly, that was Bushie Jr. ""s entire campaign to make us believe he was"" just a normal guy ""; therefore we would care, that legally he's rich & privileged idiot - but that is a completely different story.] The film not only portrays Lincoln as a simple (almost stupid) man of sorts, but it also claims that Lincoln got to the law by some chance and ilyt even cared about the law - but that all the simplistic pretences ences that the right consisted of right and wrong - not to say, right and wrong - were ostrich. In the film he is not too good a defender (as he still lies with his feet on the table and mocks the witnesses) and the result is usually a matter of chance / fortune. Moreover, unfortunately, the film is religious, racist, and conservative - partly because it was funded by Republicans (in response to some Democratic-sponsored films before), and partly because this was simply the mood of the time. Don't waste your time on this movie!"	1
It was a pretty good film. I'm not sure it's seen as a spoiler comment but I didn't mean to take a risk. At any rate, near the end of the film, the accuser reads a Bible verse, and then quotes another from memory. I can't remember the first passage that he reads, but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it's Genesis 9: 12, but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend the death penalty. It's a pity prosecutors don't even have to cite the Bible these days. Has anyone heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court justice in the country's history? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. It's a pity we lost that perspective in America.	0
Forbidden Siren is based on the Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s) game. Like most video games turning movies, Whistle I would say the majority do not translate into another medium really well. And it is the same with this painful case. In a rather long prologue, the background and preconditions of the story are explained and the location where an author (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichik主) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) will move in is determined. The villagers do not look too friendly, and soon afterward they are served good advice about the siren on the island to be kept indoors as soon as the siren starts to howl. Things begin to beat down, of course, and our brothers and sisters go on a mission in the bush, to find out exactly what's happening to the strange inhabitants of this so unfriendly island. But in reality, you won't have to worry about what's going on, like folklore and fairy tales that throw themselves in to make the plot more confused. What really pushed it into the realm of bad comedy, were its unwittingly ill-placed off-key moments, which simply provoked pathetic laughter at its sheer stupidity, to be explained much later. It is one thing to present something clever, but it is quite another to do it convincingly and without gaps in it. Although this is below 90 minutes - and I mean that in a horror movie it's taken nearly two hours - this movie, with its slow build, gives us a command to say whatever we want. recovery 眞will be the last 20 minutes, but we are dealing with a fall too little too late. What saves the film is the way he chimes and ends up unveiling. Again, this is a common way of turning a seemingly simple horror film into something extraordinary and thrilling to watch. The result was satisfactory but leaves a bad taste in the mouth because you feel cheated. There are two ways to get a feeling - either it raises the film to a memorable level or it gives you that nonsensical feeling. Sadly, Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter. The saving element will be its cinematography, with the use of lights, shadows and mirrors, but I want it to be that explicit - messaging is still not worth failing at, so better to avoid that capture.	1

"So most educational movies are nothing more than meaningless drudgery, with ""MST3K"" poking fun on them (""Why Study Industrial Arts?"" comes to mind). ""Hemo the Magnificent"" is actually pretty good. It's about the blood, the heart and the circulation. I confess that I don't remember all of it but he explains it all very well, he gets serious, but he's quite entertaining. I'm guessing June Foray will always prevail (the most famous is the voice of Rocky the squirrel, playing a deer here). Since ""Hemo the Magnificent"" itself may be hard to find, probably the best place to see the 10th anniversary of the project is in ""Gremlins."" A class watches as a Gremlin is forming."	0
"Years ago, after seeing a virulently censored version of this film on television, I was curious about the unedited version. I was surprised it was more credible and played better than I remembered, but one thing really caught my eye. I think other reviewers have pointed out that what exactly is the character Chris Sarandon's style and motivation? Has he raped other victims? Is he totally psychotic or an ""average"" sociopath? How did he get through the attack on the younger sister? Is this character even credible, or is just more background needed? He seems at one and the same time an uncomfortable, believable character, and too angry to even be given a teaching position to engage with young, vulnerable girls. This appears to be the biggest complaint ever made by viewers. This has nothing to do with its frighteningly compelling conclusion. The film occupies an uncomfortable position between sheer exploitation and extruＢserious treatment, without fully settling for either mode. Not the worst film of all time, but not especially good either."	1
"OK, so I'm hearing that this new Justin Timberlake film is out, which has some pretty big names. By this I mean great actors like The Freeman aka Morgan Freeman, an enrichment of Hollywood how totally wasted. Then along came Kevin Spacey, who I've been a big fan of since seeing ""American Beauty"" and ""The Usual Suspect."" Both of these great actors probably signed believing it would be a good movie, like I did when I heard the story. Then there's a freshly-showered Justin Timberlake. I say fresh-faced, because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven't hit him. The reason why, by the way, is that no one will ever see this movie, or even bother to read it. The film is so awful that when I had tickets for the first 15 minutes. The characters were so one-dimensional that they made many a Bible character look like Don Corleone. They got the one-liner and sound bite-worthy stuff. That symbolic, haughty black man (LL COOL J) who has an affair with a beautiful woman he never even heard of in real life. The captain is this slightly tearful chap who talks in such a high tone. And what a shitty movie it would be without its hero adding one more experience Sorgen. Oh, and lots of gun fire, I mean quite a lot. SPOILER (NOT!!!) It's the kind of important role that leaves everyone in the police force who is shooting dead and the hero holding his own. They got flamethrowers and rocket launchers, just not kidding. Bottom line, if you want to look like Edison Ereins, because you're a great fan of one of the actors, or a great fan of Justin Timberlake, all 13 years old girls out there, enjoy it! Iwish I had more hands, because I had more thumbs, because this movie is so terrible, because I could give so many thumbs down that thumbs down will mean nothing, because this movie is so terrible, because it annoys so much that it makes me laugh out of frustration at the storyline, because it just wouldn't end, because the weight and the shouting just kept on happening. We are all able to salute and save ourselves from these horrible movies. Well it could be worst, another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned horrible actor is an announcer, hehe check out IN THE MIX lol, or even get rich or diedie try '. Now what makes the film so special is that it has men over 30 who play 16 or even younger teenagers. I could go on."	1
"I remember seeing that film on TV on a Saturday afternoon in the 50s or 60s. It was immaculately presented, but I remember that there was a message of hope broadcast by channels hidden in lamppost in ligaments in one of the last crazy executions for the imminent liberation. I am not sure that will be true. Still, the film is well made. The German commanding officer announces, stirred, ""übernehmen die Russians auf der Friedrich-Ebert-Straße,"" as though all is going according to plan. I sensed that this movie, and an American one later made for TV, after the performance of the British historian Trevor Roper, with a similar title last days of Hitler, was being made. I was surprised not to see any merit in Trevor Room. I am convinced that the latest German movie about DOWNFALL was so well made as the classic. The U.S. blow was a little flat. Few characters have attracted so much attention in cinema as Adolph. I find it interesting though that none of the many films and books that have ever been published ever mention the Hitler Double that John Toland's great historical work alludes to on the margins. Was that Gibs?"	0
The concept for Sarafina is very solid, apart from its musical perspective. It tries to connect enthusiastic African music with a story about the horrific conditions and atmosphere blacks experienced when the movie was released. The contradictions in the two elements are too pointed and the film never justifies such a rapid oscillation between jubilation and horror. If only it had been a drama that reflects 배this situation, maybe it would have been a good film, but the scenes of pupils being gunned down by soldiers do not necessarily resonate alongside the songs. Aside from the weak premise that acting isn't the best either, Goldberg gives a mediocre performance as the rest of the cast. Overall a disappointment. 3 / 10	1
"This is a strange, cerebral, surreal and esoteric film. If there is such a thing as ""intellectual horror cinema,"" then it is this film. I was scared and I wish someone with me observed this game, which has little to do with a plot. I have to watch this film more than once before I feel I fully understand its content. If you like ""My Dinner With Andre"" and films by Godard or don't like regular drugs, you will certainly like this film. Wow."	0
"I really enjoyed this movie, but it's nothing new. Everyone here is Seminyak now with other war movies, this movie was misclassified! It's not a war movie, just as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is an asylum movie, or ""Cool Hand Lukas"" a prison film. This is a film about individuality, non-conformity, self-confidence and the costs of this type of personality. The plot is the same as in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Cool Hand Luke,"" so we're good company, and she stays engaged. It should be these films that should be compared to, not ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon."" Eric"	0
"Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for Sharpe's magazine, hoping to live his dream lifestyle, but struggles to make a lasting impression. This comedic drama, based on Toby Young's book on survival in American business, has received mixed reviews. Though labeled inconsistently funny but with great charm by actors, Over the aku is like a drinking poke at a cultural comedy, yet it is not. This 2008 picture works due to the actors and the simple, yet sharp story. First in the past, then the present, we move forward, and see Young making his mark on one of America's leading magazines. Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too sympathetic for words. Whether he hits zombies with the cricket bat or shows the nature of the law with his sidekick, the English actor brings charm and light-hearted charm to every scene. Here, if the script is good, but far from his own standard, he brings a lot of energy and is well worth seeing on his own. His antics with ""Babe 3"" are unforgivable, simply stunning, like his overloaded dance routines, which he brilliantly masters, however. Bridges and Anderson are good at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where Dunst fits the tangled romance well. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, is funny enough to remind everyone of a film star. The fact her character Sophie Myles is featured in an image of Mother Teresa is just as ludicrous as her character's antics in the pool. For entertainment, there's a dog, and Pegg rounds this off in a real-life British comedy, with a subtle twist. While it's a British film, there is an adaptation of American life for Young, as he attempts to blend in, and we can see the different ways to tell stories. Young wants the rights to seem dirty and the contradiction of American professionalism. The inclusion of the stars of the tabloid press will soon take this film up in time, but the notion of exploitation of movie stars gives this aspect a special character. Wilde's first picture is not perfect. Concentration disturbances are a feature accusation because the plot goes over-the-top with a twisted, evident twist, and there are too many characters to use. The physical comedy can also be overdone. By the way, the clothes on the DVD are some of the most beautiful things you'll ever see and they're nearly half an hour long. This comedy drama has Simon Pegg back on brilliant form and, with its collective approach to storytelling and sharp comedy, it is easy to see what's worth a look."	0
"I watched the video called ""Forced to his knees."" Generally, I was happy for Dolph's movies, so I tried this one out here. It wasn't worth it. I read some of the earlier comments about the box which attracted spectators. Don't be fooled. This is a bad film at best. There is no spectacle. The plot, of which there is little, is very predictable. The film seems cut in parts. It just stinks. Not even worth the price of a cheap overnight stay. As a bit of a Delphi fan I have always been waiting to see him in action. You will still be waiting at the end of the movie. It is the best place to avoid this movie and spend your time watching almost anything else."	1
"This movie is used in film tuition Live on adolescent performance in a course ""How not to Script a B-Movie."" Budget is tight, time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days), and the cast is often green and inexperienced. The one thing you have full control of is the best script you can write within the bounds set for you. Scarecrow's screenplay seems written in a haze of drunkenness. I could go through about fifteen examples of such a ludicrous script as this one, but I mention just one: the Gravedigger. The figure of the Gravedigger is introduced to the film for approximately an hour. He apparently has no connection to another of the characters, which already appear in the film. He can be seen with his daughter, who is also with no one in the film. The gravedigger must act mightily for a few scenes and then is killed to determine the body count. Why give a daughter to the gravedigger? Why should a daughter have a boyfriend? Why can it be brought to light so late in the film? Why not try to establish it as part of an ongoing story? Scarecrow doesn't seem to care. The ""story"" of Scarecrow goes something like this: Lester is a high school kid (played by an actor I would love to move to my early 30s) adopted by other kids. He paints birds and falls in love with fellow pupil, Judy. His mum is a juicy city whore. One of her confused friends is making fun of his drawings (he calls him ""a beetle"" to draw birds and not ""monsters and cowboys."" When a high school student draws cowboys, I think he will probably be more gay than a high school student who draws crows and eventually kills Lester in a cornfield under the eponymous scarecrow. Magically, Lester's soul goes into the scarecrow. Somehow, Lester's soul morphs into that of a clever gymnast this way and I know that some reviews have called the scarecrow a kung fu birdshot. I disagree. The scarecrow practically does a full floor exercise before she jumps onto the truck for the climax of the film). The scarecrow then kills those who tortured him, those who smoke in the cornfield, those who dig tombs, friends of the daughters of gravediggers, and pretty much anyone who turned up on the set. The bonus feature of the DVD should also be mentioned. The director (a French man) plays an improvised version of rap style, confesses that he enjoys having no managers on set to let his wife hit the floor while working and he gives (and I paraphrase): ""Life's a bitch but et has a great ass"" Number of beers I drank during this film: 5 Got it: None needed a number to enjoy this film to reach throat-ache levels: Whatever it takes to Blackout drunk levels."	1
"I could not agree more with another reviewer who mentions Jodorowsky. Barney seems utterly boring and uninspired. He can produce candy (and I like sweets), but his arrogance and artistic vacuity just detracts from the whole pleasure. So many people, I'm afraid, fail to distinguish between similar (but really only slight) works by Jodorowsky or more linear filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love 2001's Odyssey and I never got bored by the closing scenes...) ለThis kind of art like M. Barney's makes us confused and made genetically modified audiences who might otherwise begin to appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern ""conceptual"" art. And read his interviews. I just don't buy it, sorry. And so boring. I never became bored watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a big disappointment. Especially since it provided an opportunity to be something, in fact to tell something nonlinear and unorthodox, like the beginning and the great 貢 Choreographed dance and the preparations for the sailing from the ship. Ships ""meet"" at sea... ideas of waste as a value (if they were fecal matter). But these ""pearl grebes..."" Anything could make a grand surreal movie with some content. But he doesn't. Or the terrible presumption scenes of fancy dress and the fake tea ceremony... How vain and not real and philosophically conceited, but empty? I am doing some wonderful picturesque scenes but the whole movie was so boring and pretentious and very empty and fake that I became physically sick. And it doesn't have a good pace. I like slow movies, but in some scenes it was just boring because it was pretentious and fake - so I was just forced Anonymous through trousers that were really all it took to get this whole tedious scene... These types of movies just destroy the art and the spirit that was in my eyes. I want more Jodorowsky!! !"	1
Originally, this project was supposed to be the film adaptation of the popular japanese manga, SlamDunk! And this is nothing new for Jay Chou, who played a character of another of the most popular manga originals D in the film. Along the way it was decided to incorporate a little kung fu with the movie - hence the title, even if the idea was not a very original one. Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer comes to mind, together with martial arts and playing ball. But fortunately, ҳ-scenes where Kung Fu really influenced the games were kept to an absolute minimum and really very necessary in Kung Fu Dunk, as they neither add much to the plot, nor get too excited; they brought a few cheap laughs at most, and evoked memories of the times that Stephen Chow used Kung Fu in soccer games. Jay Chou is comfortable in his role as martial artist Fang Shi-jie, not for the first time he does battle (Curse of the Golden Flower - who? ), and he was considered to be an improbable sight under the stunt direction of Ching Siu-Tung, as he seems to be in the trailer losing innumerable thugs in a bar, material only to tell you who is the boss. It's almost why his character is proben to do kung fu, why he has an excuse to be excellent and that he can shoot from almost any angle. And with Eric Tsang playing a small temporary worker, Chen-Li, who recognizes his potential and becomes his agent, he might join a university to play varsity basketball, but that just wasn't without the initial objections of team captain Tok Xi (Chen Bo-Lin) and team owner Xiao-lan (Baron Chen, in his major-league debut). But one already knows with the team on the same page it soon unite their forces and meet adversaries on the basketball court. I'm going to stick my neck out to say this movie is like basketball - it was the gateway to football. With his charismatic character he does the sport well although he drips so much coolness and detachment onto the pitches. The special effects and the wire work of the cast made all the players look like professionals who could easily nomination the top side in NBA football, and they really did look breathtaking, especially sports like mimicking different dunking moves and doing combo moves through technique and stunt work. So the kung fu elements don't need to be in the film. Stunt work itself will properly justify the majority of pulling moves, as they are totally based on reality. But for this to happen hatte the belief that average-sized boys have feathers on their feet for jumping this height in a professional dunk. It was also unfortunate that the number of games was only a handful, with the time spent covering a huge fiziert, but each was loosely written and flopped back and forth from story as and when it wanted to. Things like the casual Shi-jie search 慌 to use the basketball games to visit his parents one day, the gangsterism permeated and affected the game, and his love life with Charlene Choi in another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing more. Everyone is behaving a little too cool, so the main characters don't have much space to bring a bit more depth to the action. One of the key issues is the perception of the importance of teamwork rather than individual talent and Uli Hoeness and this might have been proven when players played more off the field, in free play and in competitions other than high-five games and friendly passes. With a budget of $10 million it is easy to see where the money went - particularly for the episodes of a giant fantasy sequence at one critical point in the film. It's fairly well-behaved and probably vindicated in itself by its quality, but I again would point out that the basketball stunt would still provide a decent movie of imaginative basketball moves even without those parts. And playing Jay Chou for your team is a big boost for the hope of a cash hit.	0
It's fun and fast-paced. It is unlikely that the actor, who plays Mat, was eighteen. The most important thing is that he is very convincing. That he convinced her to cast him is thanks to his audition. I soon accepted him as a naive boy from the countryside. While it was the better performance, most others were highly dedicated. Especially the cooperation between the police officers was natural and balanced and worked very well. It's only about 45 minutes long, so the plot isn't complex. The style of the whole thing is more decisive. It is smooth and dynamic, and the scenery is atmospheric, especially because all the colors are extremely rich. Gangland is recognisable to foreign visitors but still manages to create a distinctively Australian character.	1
Joan Fontaine plays the villain in this Victorian-era film. She convincingly plays the married woman whose lover has at her side, set her sights on rich man Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is quite good as Miles. Miss Fontaine served her part perfectly 연 - she was clever, calculating, innocent-looking, anxious and charming at the same time. It takes an actress of extraordinary talent to do that. Joan Fontaine looked ravishing in Travis Banton's sophisticated costumes. Also part of the movie is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I can highly recommend this film.	0
"The Unborn is the story of a couple named Virginia (Brooke Adams) & Bradley Marshall (Jeff Hayenga), who have been trying for five years to get pregnant; Virginia has suffered two miscarriages since then and desperately wants a child. So they're going to visit Dr Richard Meyerling (James Karen) and ask for his help after he's been recommended by some of her friends who say he can help them have a child. Dr. Meyerling operated Virginia & it can be quickly confirmed that the surgery was successfully performed & Virginia is pregnant. At first, everything seems perfect, & the Marshall's could not be happier, but her exemplary resume doesn't last long as she sinks into Mood & acts entirely disconnected from her character; she gets a troubling phone call from Beth (Jane Cameron), another woman who underwent Dr. Meyerling's procedure and alleges that Meyerling is indeed abusing his patients for his own sinister purposes & actually is a disgraced genetic scientist. Virginia begins to wonder what grows in her... Produced and directed by Rodman Flender, I found The Unborn actually quite decent but still amazing (it is NOT a science fiction film like IMDb would have you believe). Henry Dominic's script tries things differently and it's a credit to him for that. ""The Unborn"" relies on psychological horror rather than a cheap furor & bad special effects, it has a pretty clever story based on basic human fears. It moves along at a good pace, although it's by no means necessarily an action documentary. The climax was fine & seemed appropriate for rounding off; the warnings about ""genetic disorder"" appear even more relevant today than then, maybe Flender did know what the rest of us didn't know. On the downside, there are some elements of exploitation missing and at its core, this is a dialogue driven film which concentrates mostly on a single person, so sometimes it can be a little boring. Besides, I should mention what this grinning black skateboard dwarf is all about. Director Flender does a good job; The Unborn is by no means the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made, but it is quite good enough for the film. The atmosphere is good and there is a bit of suspense with Virginia's plans revealed in a full-throated manner only at the last moment. Disappointingly, the bubbles hardly exist, which would disappoint the film in a way, because nothing really unthinkable in retrospect happens. The Unborn uses all Interessenten I recommend, but in one week I will not be allowed to remember too many. Technically, the film is okay. I think The Unborn had a fairly small budget, but it's well done even if it's a bit bland & forgettable durchs. The baby is actually quite a special effect and does have a pretty realistic facial movement. Acting is good & it was one of the first jobs attributed to Friends (1994-2004) star Lisa Kudrow, I've got to be honest, I don't like Friends & I don't even know who did it 綻, so I can't tell you how she fared. The Unborn is a good horror / thriller, which deserves to be better known & watched, but it's much better than what it is. If your horror fan isn't looking for something else now, something more intelligent, more thoughtful than usual, I think that's worse than The Unborn. Followed by the mute sequel The Unborn II (1994), which I immediately found myself watching, please watch my review if you want to.."	0
"Whether you watch the normal version of this monstrosity or the MST3K version, you must be impressed by the full GALL in this production. The film-makers insult the intelligence of the audience, from one end to the other, and seem to have a fair bit of this in mind. Everything about it is fundamentally wrong and cheap. Even the 1950s car, in flashback to that era, looks like it was taken from a junkyard. The ""Hobgoblins,"" perhaps as you know, can be ""performed"" with poorly-finished hand puppets and soft toys. If a person is to be attacked by them, it is clear that toys equate their ҙ( victim) with their own body. When the creatures come away from the two security guards, the camera - or rather not - shows them looking at the checkpoint, as they gaze down and turn their heads as if they were watching the goblins scurrying by. It reminds us of the scene in the movie ""Tannins,"" where two people stand in the ruins of a world they would devise and inspect the wreckage, and we don't see any of it. Budget constraints caused by total incompetence usually mean you don't have anything to show, so what was the point of that? The ""scenes"" were totally laughable. ""Club Scandal"" was a blatant dinner; it appears to have been a vacant house - probably for rent or sale - that the production company occupied for an hour or two to shoot the shoot. I would have been ashamed of that ""spaceship"" when I was 10 years old, building models. The reasons for the characters are not clear - Kevin is vilified for not taking ""pride"" in his relationship with his girlfriend. m sure that was supposed to make her reconciliation finally so touching but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go into hell and leave her. Nick is reportedly back from two months of army training (yes, nicer, Nick) and seems determined to prove that our land is defended by sadistic, moronic animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a phone sex geek in red shorts who dreams of a night with the spandex-clad dominatrix, but he is so untrained that he probably is gay. One of the girls is prudish and the other a swindler. And the goblins? But in the end, they all go back to the safe in which they have lived for 30 years. Why so? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this movie and marvel Chrysler's primitive style in the modern world when you own an idiotic script, incompetent directing, actors who are so bad as to be sampled out from high school theater productions, and scenes that resemble Edward D. Wood Jr."	1
"Come on, folks. This film's better than 4. I can see this happening... Wealthy people have done crazier things than that. And it was funny. I see comedy in order to be entertained, to escape the pressures of the world for a short time and not have to treat anything too seriously. This film is entirely in line with that objective. I judge a film by its own merits, and I am not going to compare Surviving Christmas to Flaming Seas. I watched utterly dysfunctional people develop into caring, personable individuals who could live comfortably away from home on the streets. It will continue on the list of ""favorite..... must be on the watch for the holiday season."" If you just want to have 90 minutes of fun then watch this video again."	0
"""Broken Bow"" takes us back to where it all began. It's set 150 years into our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are. This episode on the To-Done series is, I think, about the first series since ""TOS"" that revives feelings of wonder, danger, and relief after ""Going Where No Man Has Gone Before."" Scott Bakula has a superb cast as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first Star Ship Enterprise. He and the crew are showing real reverence for the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley is brilliant as alien Dr Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is absolutely luscious as the alluring but logic Vulcan science officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is the best first episode of any of these treks, in my opinion, and I think Gene Roddenberry would be proud of it for sure."	0
"I watched this movie countless times in the late 60s / early 70s when it went at the Saturday Kids ""School matinee every November and December. JUST THE WORLD WATN'T (up, can I say Christmas? ), perhaps the best, most iconic Christmas movie of all time. I was amazed all the way through at the almost ""pink and white"" iridescent form the screen colour of SANTA CLAUS, to the point where the colour of the french pinion tears off colour. The film is kind of scary! I thought it then - and I still do today. I was as entertaining then as I am now! Which, in a way, is a suspense epic. By the way, the picture quality on the DVD which I have now looks much better than in wein-years 1969-74 in the theatre. If you are waiting for ""the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special"" now, forget it! If you want to make FELLINI DONE CHRISTMAS, read... By nature, the dubbing of zunächst movies (it has been described as a Spanish version) always makes it seem ""a surreal experience."" This contributes to the film's inherent strangeness. It is also quite terrifying that an ""evil demon"" (as outlined in the original American trailer) is 一Ι trying to ""malign"" decent kids throughout the movie. A particularly nightmarish scene depicts a little boy wishing that his parents were at Christmas, but all of a sudden the ""Harbour Family"" budgets themselves out of a huge ""Christmas surprise"" and realise that he's only a daydreamer! But look, Christmas lovers - and when you're on one, your stash saves - this movie will make you believe you're on... no drugs at all!"	1
"'Why? ' Every New Yorker had to ask this simple question during the twelve months of terror David Berkowitz created from 1976-77. 22 summers later, the same word probably emits the same bewildering question when people show up at 饲, the theaters where the banal and exploitative ""Summer of Sam"" is performed. Spike Lee tries to weave the tale of a pack of misguided crooks in search of the celebrity psychopath who paralyzed New York City for more than a year into a dramatic and vivid account of the murders, the demons in Berkowitz's head, and the frustrating nature of a futile New York manhunt. He presents an ensemble of abhorrent losers who, devoid of love, honour or humanity, listen to their own barking dogs, unlike Berkowitz. Lee has upstaged the audience in almost every shot: ""None of us is what we seem to be."" Lee, often a critic of the white establishment, maintains the stereotype by engaging in a scene where Mira Sorvino, who plays a freshly married woman with a cheating husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man in the back room of a large black Cadillac. An Italian mafia boss tells a black criminalist that Willie May's famous backwards catching him was ""luck."" Lee even summed up the racist thoughts of a middle-aged blacks, declaring ""I'm happy that this is a white guy killing all those white people, because if it were a black guy who killed all these whites, there would be the biggest race riots in New York City history."" Except for one renowned opening scene from a disco arrival (recalling shots from Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" or Orson Welles """" The Third Man ""), there is nought soul, purpose, or passion in this movie. He parades character on the screen who is devoid of human decency. Even though we do not know the real victims of this terrible attack, Spike Lee seems to be saying that New York City got what it deserved during this horrible boiling summer over two decades ago. How could anyone make such a mess in their beloved city? ""How can someone show such hatred against his fellow man?"" Are these questions appropriate for Berkowitz or Lee? They decide."	1
"Watching Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you see, nothing's going to go wrong. But what can I say? That was a terrible misfire. The movie is about an old man, Peter Sellers, who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young woman, who is playing an attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The film is incredibly fragmented, and I don't understand it at all. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people but the film doesn't prove that. This song about ""Arabella Cinderella"" is pretty cool but that's it. I only recommend this film to people who want to see some extreme news films, it's almost the definition of one. I believe that this film is more than anything a continuation of time, in 킨in terms of its certain experimentalism and unconventionality, the problem is that the quality is entirely filmed and the script, let alone the approach of directing, is so igelda. Especially Peter Sellers will have a hard time going over Dr. Strangelove and Being There in his career to silly films such as this one ⊂ and in the case of Magic Christian, which had a lot in common with this film in their context and style but this movie had a few funny moments. It is pointless, and I am sad, when a guy like Peter Sellers is so great in this film. Not recommended for everyone."	1
"I was very surprised by the film. I was touched by the life Paul was through, on the way to find his ""Marie,"" the little girl from whom he was separated. The humour was also very good and didn't do the story any harm, as I thought that probably made it. Originally I expected a cracker joke like ""paulie wants a cracker"" to hurt the film, but even this happened in a very humorous scene that gets moving when Paula is in the press conference. Who wants to see a good movie about a ""talking animal"" should see it, much better than in my opinion Dr. DOLITTLE. PAULIE has another surprising twist, which is well done."	0
"Fascinating. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the great story being told. From dramatic acting to rare visual effects, LOST is the must-watch TV show for fans of science fiction, fantasy, action, adventure and mysteries. Every cast member is so well chosen, and so good in their roles that you either love them or hate them or even wish them to die. The visual effects, if you use them (which is rare) styled to produce a show, are actually quite good. Whether it's the ""smoker monster, Ј: For the polar bears LOST is a feast for the eyes. As far as the storytelling is concerned, nothing compares with the enormous complexity of the show that 匕 Stimme makes viewers like me endure. Beginning / end, continuity is virtually perfect, characters are developed and the ever evolving story slowly provides the answers to their questions that so many crave. Overall, LOST is practically unblemished. It does for drama / science fiction television what Arrested Development has done for comedy: it sets the bar high. I strongly recommend LOST to those who are patient, intellectual and who love every moment of riding, however long it takes for the destination to be reached. See this show."	0
"Reign Over Me is also a success, thanks to the impressive work by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. While comedians doing dramaturgical work are perceived as a distraction, Sandler is no stranger to more serious roles, too. Most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temperament and vulnerability that can burst at any moment. It might even have a character typing character characteristic of characters with problems of such hidden rage holder. But unlike his roles in less comedic crime dramas like Punch and Judy and Spanglish, this performance has some high-profile drama. In the film Alan Johnson (Cheadle) meets his old roommate Charlie Finerman (Sandler) whom he hasn't seen for several years. Five years earlier Charlie had to endure the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash. Charlie hardly recognises Cheadle's character, owing to the restraint of his memories and his consistently aloof childish lifestyle, since the accident. It was only when Alan refused to engage him in conversation that Charlie remembered who he was. Their subsequent relationship allowed Finerman to have a boyfriend who did not talk about his loss, ultimately enabling him to address the thoughts and feelings he suppressed on his terms. Although scriptwriter Mike Binder hardly shows any sense of individual style and is somewhat awkward with before and after shots and transitions with the camera, he has a knack for exposing actors to good or bad depictions and is also a talented and funny writer. He shot this film with a digital camera, as more and more filmmakers now do, allowing the team to shoot the scenes with limited lighting. Though it focused on colorful backgrounds for New York, digital grain of color designs often emerged that resemble and move crosses we encounter scattered on a screen. Almost all the characters in Reign Over Me give a great performance. Jada-Pinkett Smith and Liv Tyler are unforgettable respectively in their roles as frustrated wife Cheadle and as psychiatrist. Sandler and Cheadle, however, have made some of their best work available. They owned the entire movie. Sandler plays a character who, on the surface, does not look or act like him, partly through his Bob Dylan-esque wig. Though Cheadle's character has more screen time than Sandler, they should both be considered starring, supporting and helping each other throughout the film. Music also plays a big part in the movie, especially the title song ""Reign Over Me"" (Reign Over Me) by The Who, later covered by Pearl Jam. In one of the film's strongest moments, Sandler shows how to discontinue his feelings and memories through music; but precisely this song evokes so intense emotions that it does not diminish his anger but stokes it. On balance, Reign Over Me is a pleasantly sad but often funny film, driven by astonishing leads."	0
"Jack (Matthew Lillard) enters the studio of the scam antiques collector Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious old buddy and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie doesn't buy his story, dominating Jack and tying him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes 100,000 US dollars for each to protect him in negotiations with a rich and dangerous collector over the ""Spanish judges"" on antiques. Max invites his stupid friend Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who arrives with his delayed girlfriend, who thinks she's coming from Mars, to put the team together. Jack, however, crosses the colleologism double-crossing and then he intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. The low-budget production ""Spanish Judges"" is a movie with a reasonable script and a grim finish that squandered a good cast. Valeria Golino is unbelievably beautiful but, together with good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they fail to save the stupid story. In addition, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately don't work, and in fact it's silly and not funny at all. I have three votes. Title (Brazil): ""Tudo Por Dinheiro"" (""Everything for money"")"	1
Boring, predictable horror outing that seems ╩ worthwhile according to the numbers involves at least pretty good special effects, and lots of (pointless) chaos and pag省️ torment to satisfy (mindless) genre fans. It's mostly about giants of rats fidgeting to a number of characters we don't really care about - if that's your thing, get ready. (* 1 / 2)	1
"Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school student who discovers that she garnered a punch and begins an amateur training program at a gym in Brooklyn. Santiago Douglas is a handsome young man, barely older than her, who also trains there. They kind of meet after class and feel attracted to each other. No sex. Santiago has been instructed to save it for his next attack. Both are participating in a gender-blind sports programme that doesn't discriminate between men and women - a misleading attempt at level playing field. A conservative radio host recently announced - and I swear I'm not - ""let's face it, the president's black."" I'm there to make an equally trenchant observation: ""Men and women are different."" In 99 out of 100 cases, it is not yet possible to measure physical performance. But for the top 1 percent - coached athletes whose skills are honed to a fine line - men generally have the edge. With their narrow hips they can walk faster. And they have greater muscle mass and a stronger torso. These differences in physique allow women to bear and raise children and men to collect and destroy their food. This sexual fork is the result of the quite normal process of natural selection. Without her there might not be a human being. And that, boys and girls, is why they see men and women at the Olympics. I speak to you as your anthropologist. That is ten cents, preferably from PayPal. This is why I have misdirected this gender-blind programme. As talented a boxer as Rodrigues was: approaching the zenith of her game, she will eventually lose to a man. That's where the complications occur in this movie. Rodrigues then takes on her boyfriend, Douglas. Neither wants to escape the anger of the other, not to mention coalition rights, but pride is at stake, and pride is attained by both men and women. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is insulted by what she sees as her patronizing attitude. It ends happily. I didn't expect much from the film. I thought it was a rip-off of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby,"" until I found out it was being published years earlier. And I had never heard of the director or any of the cast. Such confusion normally bodes ill for bad news - whether it's on television or on the air. But I was surprised at how neatly it came together. The priceless absence of the bathos left me open-mouthed. Nor is the minimal use of boxing cliches -- the frayed cords, the blood, the swollen, bruised eyes, the bruised faces after the fight, the fat, sweaty spectators chanting ""kill him! , ""the slow landing of a glove on the nose, the spray of sweat in his smashed head, the heroic music signalling the long awaited apotheosis of the victor. None of that here -- well, almost nothing. One could describe the whole action as formulaic. Tough kid finds outlet in the ring etc. The feeling you get is that's probably about what these amateur competitions are like. Unlike those we see on television or in ordinary films. No bells rang, instead a dancing and attentive referee yelled, ""Hold on!"" And ""Box!"" The participants wear head gear. The gym is not populated by cheering spectators, but only a handful of people who are particularly interested in what goes on. It's a clean film, despite the rather gloomy setting and unlucky family dynamic. Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty mean with the muscular mass and glowing eyes underneath her lowered forehead, but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl blowing your 15 by 13-inch toothbrush whenever she wants and once you hear the feminine contours of her super segments, she's not too bad. (The scene of her pushing her father to the ground is an exaggeration.) It was a little hard to understand Douglas's restraint as Rodriguez crawls across his bed. Director Karyn Kusama has carefully chosen her talent. Shows what can be done with some talent, imagination, and a little bit of money. There should be more films like this. Take one of those multibillion-dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or spaceships and spread the largesse a little."	0
"Unhinged was part of the film selection for the public affairs film Video Nasty, which was produced in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Keep that filthy stuff out of the children, doesn't you know? In many ways, the rationale for the uproar must have been questions. By today's standards Unhinged is a tame little fairy tale. Three girls at a jazz concert and you know right away that the body count is going to be quite low. You get lost in the woods and get a car accident that looks so fake it's ridiculous. They are picked up by several residents who live in a scary house in the middle of the woods. One of the girls is critically injured and has to stay upstairs. Then there's talking. Talk about why the girls are there at all, and how they have to be on time for dinner, because mom doesn't like that someone's late. And now we talk even more. Yakkyak-yak. Some tension builds as a madman runs around and molestes the girls, and someone looks through holes in the walls with his eyeball for pretty girls who look like Hitchcock's Psycho. I digress, because there is so much blather about this film that one wonders when the murders will begin. One of the girls is so bored that she goes alone into the woods looking for the city. Smart move. She probably knew about the solitary maiden adventure, walking alone in the forest but didn't worry. After that, the conversation continues - we are still waiting and waiting until the next girl may or may not be killed. And then there's the twist and turn. For some it is the unexpected, for others it is the real. This is pretty much the only reason anyone really wants to watch these games. I don't care how twisted she is, nothing in this movie compensates for the most boring period I've ever seen. Even with the minor effect of the ending, the filmmaker just didn't have what it took to deliver a good story. It would have been a much better 30 minutes - one hour television episode, say. If you really need all of that for some reason, Formulate, just to say you've watched every slasher movie so far, do yourself a favour and hold the Fast-Forward button ready. Since there are so many irrelevant scenes in this movie you just type in and you come to a conclusion: ""WOW, that's it this time."" Oh, and half way through the game there is a shower scene with two girls showing off bed-bees. Horror for the bees. Those magnificent sums that honeybees make."	1
