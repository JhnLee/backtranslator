"Hollywood has officially gone too far now, and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture despite a good box office result actually leads to a backlash against its crap machines. If you are an industry person that reads our comments and looking for guidance on how to proceed Brooch, STOP. Stop turning our TV shows into these disgusting, stupid, money-wasting time films that fall by the wayside. And this action proves one thing: Hollywood is running out of ideas and watching the films it plays only continues the cycle of abomination. more What's next -- you guys who are going to ruin Bionic Man?? The film is plainly wrong and it manages to completely wrong the silliest, simplest fact about the show by forgetting (or ignoring) that Tom Wopat & John Schneider's Bo & Luke Duke * * were moonshiners. They were beaten, learned lessons, went straight to the front and were there to help and great neighbours who by chance shoot dynamite darts from hunting arrows and mortar rounds like Steve McQueen. Denver resident Uncle Jessie Pyle was also the moral focal point of the family, always insisting that the boys do good things, even at their own expense or embarrassment, while making sandwiches and coffee when the house was doing its best. They were always doing the right thing, and they had a kind of serious naivety, which was very appealing. We wanted to be more like them than us, sorta. s favourite trick was that they always seated themselves tight before they flew off, which was obviously too morally bleak for this film. By turning the Duchess family into an aviation group, Far-sightedness, Criminal, Redheads Misogynistic loser, the movie has no moral stand Where this series was entirely about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were - should the Duke boys? I wanted to punch them in the nose. It seems as though producer types have a lot of free time to work on the farm, and they end up with less than noble goals, if not a pair of 14-year-old boys that didn't grow up. No marijuana use, no gaffes, no baby bump & boobs, no sneakiness from da Hood's Brothers. It all looks like the job of a marketing consultant doing a survey on what 14-year-old boys would like to see in a film. The trouble is that 14-year-old boys can't possibly remember the programme. IMHO shouldn't be watching this movie. And parents who may feel nostalgic for the show will be disgusted by what the writers are offering. Directors & producers only did it to separate us from our money. That's how I feel. What were they thinking??? And boy, have they got Daisy wrong! Jessica Simpson is as sweet as a slut at Pamela Anderson's shopping mall - the only reason to be saddened by her shame - but you can imagine her needs by downloading promotional photos, printing them out and pinning them to the walls in the restroom. It is virtually unseen in the film (the movie's sole saving grace), and the ten minutes or so spent watching it by Swift was already overwhelming. Catherine Bach's Daisy may have had the same type of shorts and long legs that people treat with amusement if you just look at her, but the Daisy she played was * PERSON *. The adulation she brought about by simply being who she was had a near-natural ring to it. She's still one of pop culture's most outrageous icons but there was someone here. And above all, she was a likable, caring person who could not prevent the guys pouncing on her. Jessica Simpson, on the other hand, appears fake, gimmick, make-up, costume, pose aloof, bored, out of place and in that outfit I think she doesn't look good at all. She does not look like a human, but a plot that formed in a deal with someone representing her agent. Mrs Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend the whole thing never happened. Whatever the joke, she never plays along and is shamefully exploited by T & A. If this is all she wants from her career, the sequel is produced by the management, if only to give herself enough screen time, because that effort was just pitiful. The bottom line is SKIP IT. For two tickets and a slurpee to go, you can take one of Warner Bros. ""s excellent box sets from the original shows to DVD and the whole family can watch them together. That's why it worked. The only real purpose that I can see in the film will be the future to use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay. Twenty minutes of it they sing in the chorus. 1 / 10 And I mean them. AND LOCATION Hell FROM THE BIONVIAN MAN, you snooks"	1
"The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts on her past. The flashbacks deal with a weekend where young Ann finds herself attending the wedding of her friend Lila. At the wedding she met Harris who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs in her professional and family life, she remembers him as her great love. Her daughter Constance is older, ""more responsible,"" a mother of two and has a lot in common. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job, unsure as to how her life will proceed. First, the good. The historical detail in the film is great. Clothes, hair, cars, houses, etc. You really are transported to another time and place. We are dealing with a very high quality performer today. Vanessa Redgrave is very good at depicting the main character and her unstabile state of mind in the final moments of her life. Claire Danes is beautiful and she did her job as the main character when she was young (and she is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy breathed life into the character of Lila's brother Buddy. Now on to evil, and that is all. Things keep confusing history as it unfolds for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is right. They're having fun and dancing. You'd think that she doesn't produziert see him as a more important person than a boyfriend and that his Buy-In jingles that annoy her. And I thought the whole ""he might be gay"" thing came out of the blue and was of no use. Then we have Harris. The character looks wooden and creepy. If it had been a different genre, we would have known immediately that Harris was a serial killer. s an unbelievable amount of time to think all these girls would have loved him so much (but of course they still portray the other boys as pretty lame if not to help him). And the biggest problem of all. Why don't Ann and Harris get together? They fall in love with each other. In a dirty garden hut they experience the night of sex, come home, find out of Buddy's tragic end and finally come... Nothing. A few years later, they see each other again and get misted, and all I have left is to wonder. Why? The film never tells you why they were forced to marry other people, and therefore it was difficult for me to feel their pity. The part that takes place in present day reality is rather boring. The clichéd good daughter and the clichéd bad daughter. Nina changes like this as the film progresses, but I don't know why. I'm not sure that's what makes them change their lives. There is a touching scene, where her daughters meet old Ann, who dreams of following a butterfly. It's really lame and embarrassing. ""There're no mistakes,"" Ann advises us. The statement does not echo the story. And it doesn't sound true after you've watched the film and the talent of such good actors has been wasted."	1
"THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most unwieldy, unpredictable and unsettled chaos ever created in France. There's nothing worse than that a French production trying to squeeze out films made in Hollywood Venedig and China is a perfect example of such wannabe horror, action / buddy fiction. I almost stopped it halfway through because I knew it would only come down to French guys that want to show off. The film begins promisingly, like a kind of wide-ranging horror film, but they change genres - from horror to action to X-ray movie-type - to be everything, but none at the end. It's so full of clichés that at one point I thought it was a comedy. The painful dialogue and the silent pauses, in which fading out only occurs in the right exposition moments, have made me groan. I thought this hackneyed technique was only in use in Hollywood films. The chase scene in which Vincent Cassel pursues the killer is so frenzied and exaggerated that it is almost a matter of beauty. The high point on the Diplomat Hill, with handelt revelation about AC-12 killers Cassel and Reno as ""buddies"" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, made the previous talk-show success completely implausible. It is difficult to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA, though he had some problems - and it's not nearly as awful as this crazy messy film."	1
"I was introduced to Bourne Identity five years ago and have to admit that I don't think much of it. I was eleven years old at the time and perhaps too young to really get involved in the story as well as fully understand the whole scenario. When Bourne Supremacy arrived two years ago, I thought it was a better film than Identity, but I still didn't think it was quite as good as I expected from the trailers. In the past two years, they've often told me the Bourne films were great; often forcing me to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies. I can't say anything about the Bourne ultimatum until two months ago. I was literally not meant to see it. But then I decided to go back and look at the first two before making any abrupt decisions. So I went and bought the two original films. And what a surprise that was when I got the same impression. I found the superiors of the pair, but Supremacy is not far away. They are both smooth, action-packed and thrilling films that I have seen several times since I bought them. For that reason, I was the first in the line to observe the Bourne Ultimatum today. And boy didn't Bourne's ultimatum disappoint! Matt Damon had never been one of my favourite actors until he appeared in The Bourne Movie, I'd seen him in the hugely talented Mr Ripley, but I never thought much of him in general. It seems, however, that he was born for the role of ""Bourne"" (forgive the pun). ""Throughout this series, we've seen character change before our eyes, in this film, we see Matt Damon at his very best and even better than he was when he left the theater. I thought he was one of the best things in leaving the movie theater. You will focus your concern on the character and hope he finds out all. Matt Damon plays the role with a quiet intensity, and you always find his character highly believable. Also outstanding was the supporting cast of the film. Joan Allen was one of my favourite characters in Bourne Supremacy and she's stood out. Her character is also very believable, and she has some splendidly played moments towards the end of the film. Julia Stiles reappears as Nicky and we finally get a glimpse of her character. Julia Stiles is a hugely underrated actress and I thought she earned a lot more roles, good-looking parts, than she would get. David Strathairn is a new actor in the show as Noah Vosen, he's definitely the villain in the movie and he's really emanating something. He's definitely the worst character we've met and some of his decisions are really nasty. Strathairn is enjoying the part and he also has some fantastic scenes in the film. The film's Albert Finney deserves a special mention, who makes the most of his too short screen time, I don't want to say anything about the character, which remains surprising, but trust me, his scenes are some of format's highlights. The Bourne films have always had a strong focus on storytelling, not action sequences, which doesn't mean there's a lack of action sequences, but my goodness no, there are many of them spread over all films. But it's a well-written and well-acted story throughout the film. This storyline ends in the best possible manner. Watching Supremacy the night before the ultimatum, it was nice because I could see the small things beginning to fade. That very last scene in Supremacy, in New York, far more important than I could ever imagine. It will not spoil for people, but I recommend to look before ultimatum suprematus. But this ultimatum is sure to be resisted by many people simply because of its action sequences. I should condemn them and say that they should see it for the plot, but I'd??? re lying if I didn??? t say that my favourite tunes from the Bourne series are all car chases. The miniature car chase in Identity is one of my favorite car chases of all time. Well, the plot of Ultimatum must be the best from the Bourne series. In fact, the film begins with an action sequence in Moscow. So during the film we get many beatings, all of them very violent and shockingly brutal. A motorcycle chase that is fantastic, many great car chases, an exciting and unforgettable chase, and oh, and much more. For me however, the highlight is the scene at Waterloo station which makes me feel that it was not ruined but seizure for some reason. So any weaknesses for the movie? In my opinion no, but if you're not a fan of the Bourne series and have not seen the last two, I wouldn't recommend ultimatum for you. The film is not trying to garner new fans because it sticks to what the franchise does best by just adding a bit of extra plot and action sequences. The Bourne Ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. As a James Bond fanatic, it is a great honour to say that Ultimatum is far better than the vast majority of Bond films and trust me I must say a great deal. Although Bourne might not be a better franchise overall than the Bond series, it is."	0
"I'm sorry, but whenever I see a movie where a woman limp beats a man and the man just crouches, it loses visions of credibility. So the new (female) Starbuck defaced it right before it even got under way (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was more plausible than the melancholy heroic Kattee Saack, whose high-pressured performance is unlikely to be lauded by today's editors as ""compelling, exciting, particularly worth watching, ground breaking."" But finally it's a tired old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder, as big as a terraced house: currently the biggest cliché on the film screen. I can probably give this series another shot, but human cartoons alone will not keep me on my toes. James Hilton once complained: ""Please tell me a story, just give me a story."""	1
"I will not forget this film or the events that led up to Jonestown in Guyana. This may seem tragic, but it must be told. Powers Boothe gives a commanding performance. Jim Jones from obscurity to total madness. It would easily have won him an Oscar if it had arrived in cinemas. It is a sort of miniseries that you'll never forget. One does not forget images of the brutality, control and obsession of its leader. His rise and fall and the threat from the outer world to destroy what he saw as this paradise. Mass suicide is horrific, almost unreal to the idea why so many people (over 900) were willing or able to resist Jones ""orders. They don't make miniseries like this any more, in which you're just waiting, mouth open and hungry, to know what's happening to the rest of them."	0
This comedy is really not funny. It's a romance so defined by stereotypes, it doesn't have any impact. It's such a derivative caper film - I mean, it didn't have a hook at that time. The cast is adequate. More is hard to say. But it's nice that the players are unused to it. The movie would have starred Robert Montgomery at MGM. The wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses. We can be grateful that this little-known film is staffed with actors who are largely unknown today. And the production values aren't dreadful. Yet it doesn't make a real impression. It's a knockout blow. And who wants that?	1
"This may be unbelievable, but this film recorded 878,138 dollars in Russia! It is opening at almost all cinemas and is still running! Well, I don't have a clue why distributors are taking this particular ""film,"" which was barely shown worldwide. It is a sort of conundrum! Haha! Perhaps it was because another film, ""Pledge This,"" starring Paris Hilton, which has been mostly released only on DVD, was screened in Russian big-screen theaters and grossed more than $1 million. Both movies have also had a lot of promotion, for example, banners all over town, TV adverts and so on. When I say film, I mean it's boring and absolutely boring. It could actually be better. Even if it's Jessica Simpson."	1
Somewhere I read that this film is supposed to be a comedy. after seeing it, I would call it anything but. The point of this film eludes me. These dialogues are all extremely superficial and absurd, some scenes seemed like thoughtful reflections and, despite the nudity and indirect sexual content, there is nothing erotical about this movie... offen, makes me wonder what the hell that thing is! The title premise could have been a comical (if politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, however, we are subjected to cheap, amateurish, unfinished sketches and depravity and altruism for their own sake. If that's what I want then I'll buy a new one.	1
In 1933, Bali officials were ordered to remove them from the film because of its content, and the fact that Lily Powers, (Barbara Stanwyck), would do anything to claim huge wealth and power. s father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14, and she grew up in an ironworks in a city with very poor people. Her father also held an English course, which brought all kinds of male characters to his house to see Lily. As the plot progresses, Lily meets one by one, and at some point finds a man who has it all and acts as a bank president at Playboy. ), who was only twenty-five at the time of the picture-making, and Jimmy hadn't even reached Lily, even for lunch. A very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) plays Barbara Stanwyck, and both have given outstanding performances. This is a great movie from 1933, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, was caught up in a mistake for many years and has just been shown on the screen. This movie is quite mild in comparison to what we're seeing on the screens in Hollywood today, but it was very cheeky to see it. Enjoy	0
OK Clara Bow silent movie from 1927, it's a Rain spin-off with Bow being a half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple civic king who falls in love with the dimwitted Englishman Clive Brook. Bow competes for the attention with his local widow (Arlette Marchal), but both women are extraordinarily surprised when his wife (Patricia Dupont) arrives. The predatory wife is ready for divorce until she discovers that he may be on the verge of a fortune. Bow quickly restores her truck. Bow does have personality, and he has some great scenes: her opening nude bath, her hula in a grass gown, and the doggie scene where Bow and Brook do their own stunts. Note: the IMDb credit file is incorrect. The movie opening credits (the DVD I have) named Patricia Dupont as Mrs. Haldane - not Margaret Truax, as listed on IMDb.	0
"The Young Victoria is a beautiful film that shows Queen Victoria in a different light from what everyone thinks she is. The film wipes away the ""I'm not amused"" impression of Queen Victoria, showing that she was a jolly young woman. As I love history, especially that of the Victorian Republic Gesellschaft, you can imagine my reaction when I saw this movie being announced for the first time and observed it so candidly, that the days were numbered until it hit cinemas. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I learned a lot of new facts about Queen Victoria that I hadn't heard before, and I was very interested in her. Queen Victoria in so many lights was one of our greatest emerging monarchs of all time, and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like. She was treated so badly by her adviser, Sir John Conroy, because he was seeking to rule over Britain. This is what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic Queen, which she was too! The romance between her and Albert has been so deep and Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend have done so very well, she beams! Young Victoria is a love story with the heart, but a great look at a major part of British history... I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! 10 / 10... for sure!"	0
"Films like this and C.R.A.Z.Y. make me really sad about American movies with a homosexual subject. Aside from Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain, there are few other noteworthy American films with the same depth and seriousness as this one, The Bubble. This film is about two men, Noam and Ashwar, an Isa and a Palestinian, respectively. Their relationship is complicated by tensions between Jews and Arabs in Israel. Couples in the early stages of their relationship will have to struggle with who will call next - or who will say, ""I love you."" Noam and Ashwar's initial love was complicated by suicide bombings, armed security checkpoints and racism. While Noah's friends agree with and like Ashwar, who is Arab, it is clear that the majority of Tel Aviv residents may not do so. One of the best moments in this film, and there are many, is when Noam and Ashwar get to work on a production of ""Bent."" As moviegoers we see them looking at this play, and the influence it has is deeply unpalatable, in their eyes. And this moving moment is shown in a very sad way at the end of the flick. Ohad Knoller and Youseff 'Joe' Sweid are outstanding as Noam and Ashwar. Director Eytan Fox brilliantly manages to create a compelling and interesting new narrative of the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. Yet while most movies nowadays have sex (almost sports), this one goes back to the old and very true version of sex combined with love and passion. It's so refreshing. It is also refreshing to observe two gay men as characters rather than as caricatures. There are cartoon characters in this movie. Not the two gay guys. Somewhere on this page I believe to have read a comparison between the film and ""Friends."" Well, not really. Yes, these are childhood characters, whose first hard steps to adulthood and into relationships easily slip away. But I can't remember at one point being ""blow blown"" as the backdrop for the convoluted stories in ""Friends."" This is a very good film. He has heart, and heartache. And as with all good love stories, love prevails. But not in the intact glory of its full bloom. Still, this is a very satisfying film."	0
"The image that film studios have of financial incentives over creative means is not without truth (more true than false). That makes one wonder why Castle Rock Entertainment allowed Kenneth Branagh to produce a full-length, unedited version of ""Hamlet,"" where he performed the full production. Of course Branagh had to agree to some concessions (a star-studded cast, and a 2.5-hour version for bigger theatres), but why should the film studio allow Branagh to spend money on a four-hour version that few knew they'd see? In this case at least, could they have had enough respect for the material and Branagh's view of the world to mean anything to a few? This is not a question I can answer. Whatever the reason, this is a glorious vision for all who are ready to watch four hours of ""Hamlet."" As everybody knows the story, I'm not going to spend much time on it. Contrast it with other areas of performance of the piece, including the stage, but this is a completely uncut production that has never been conducted before. So some people think Shakespeare never intended to produce this film uncut and the choice about what it would contain was left to the director. Given that, I've no doubt Branagh would have been overjoyed at his staging - given he could have seen it. The film is top heavy with movie stars, even if most of the parts have only small roles. Everyone's playing their part equally well. I would have thought Branagh too old to play the role of Hamlet and so he may still be now, but his performance more than attains that. Hamlet is a complex piece, showing all the emotions, from sadness and anger and happiness to madness and everything in between. Branagh struck. Derek Jacobi is terrific as cunning Claudius whose deception and betrayal set all this in motion. His singular voice is a perfect match for the role. Julie Christie is also excellent as Gertrude, Hamlet's caring mother, who arrives late to see what is happening. The classical actors are cast in small roles (Judi Dench is dead 45 seconds short), but they're at least around. Surprisingly, no one takes that to heart, but <unk> 従, everyone gives everything and even shows it. In particular, Jack Lemmon and Billy Crystal, who are outstanding. Robin Williams is a little too drab, but he's not that bad (his role is quite small). Yet this is undoubtedly Branagh's show. He chose one of history's most famous plays, and made one of the whales responsible for a project: you can be pleased to have won, but the fact that the film is so good is a monumental achievement. What I liked about that film is that you don't have to be a Shakespearean scholar to have fun. Shakespeare, as most people know, is hard to digest, but Branagh and his cast understand that. ""Hamlet"" is immensely fun, simply sitting and listening to the performers, producing excellent dialogue and excellent acting. This is a must for everyone. It's four hours long but it's worth it for sure."	0
"It is so rare that I have found a literary work that has returned adequately to the screen that I may have valued that film higher than it deserved, but not by much. As a long-time student of Vonnergard's work, I would not hesitate to recommend the book to his readers, at least those who love him like me. The cast is inspired: Nolte is understated in triumph, confounding in defeat, resolute in judgment. Sheryl Lee might appeal a little too much, but her handling of the treacherous burden and tragic crescendo make her beauty nearly forgotten. Alan Arkin provides an infinitely more endearing but equally insidious Soviet spy. You don't necessarily need to read Mothers Night to appreciate the film; if you haven't read Mothers Night, then you're probably going to want to. Note the shifts from color to black and white and again, and don't miss the final symbolism of Campbell's noose. See also the cameo for Kurt Vonnegut at the end of the film. Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" will never sound like that (I'm just writing about mid-December, when it є becomes the big radio play, and that drives me mad)."	0
"This movie deserves more than one. But I'll give him a one because there's so many kids who give him a 10, that leads to a score that puts him in the top 100. Seriously, it's not that good, it's not that bad. It's an idiot-poor cult classic, with so many boisterous fan-boys it's ridiculous. These are guys probably still now laughing at Chuck Norris jokes and saying, ""I'm rick james b! tch,"" no matter how old or annoying it gets. ""I'm afraid in a couple of months"" time I'll be sick of hearing MFn's snakes on that MFn aircraft ""by idiots trying to be funny. His crappy plot-crap-acting set etc. It's OK to love a bad film, but you have to admit it nonetheless. Wait for the Navy with John Cena If You Want to See a Real Movie"	1
Well thought out - partly from all that happened Verbesserte, partly behind the scenes, partly unedited - and all in the same very troubled style that made the original series so funny. I just wish it had been 10 years ago to bring in more immigrant workers who have taken up the legacy.	0
The only aspect of the film that saves him from being my least favourite celluloid plastic waste is a single line delivered by an agent trying to wrap up the man-eating tomatoes by putting on a tomato costume: 'Can someone put your ketchfiziert away, please?' I urge anyone with a sleep disorder to use this film as a sedative; it works better than a Demarol overdose.	1
"I think ""The Best of Times"" has been a lost cause, since the beginning. The initial premise (guy drops the winning touchdown pass against a rival high school team, can't seem to get over it and then reunite the two teams to play again) is one of the most stupid I've ever heard. As Ron Shelton made much better sports movies, I wonder whether there was no more to it. I hope the film wasn't as much of a story as I described above. So we have the premise. If you want to go away from there, think or hope that there are a couple of turning points along the way to keep things lively. No such luck. The script does follow all the predictable cliches you could imagine. There is not one moment in this movie that you do not see a step forward before Saisonende announces it and the end... unless you figure it out by the end of the first part, then you haven't been paying personal attention or listening to any other sporting film in your life. Robin Williams and Kurt Russell star (and received the prize). Williams is the poor schmo who introduced the big pass, and Russell is the quarterback who threw the fateful pass. Gee, do you think Russell will just watch over again to see if he and Williams can rectify an injustice that the city has never forgotten? This is such a lame duck comedy with a lame duck script that you can only shake your head at what might have been. Surely there are some chuckles and frankly a really funny scene. Williams and Russell have marital problems and the wives invite her out to dinner to sort things out. They know neither of them are invited on a Monday and, yes, Monday Night Football is on. Assuming the two Spieth teams manage only one victory together, the men (especially Williams) will try to resist the temptation to figure out where the game will end. As Williams sets out to check the result and uses her bathroom visit as a ruse, the scene dissolves into a hilarious few runaways. When he returned he coughed up Russell the score. Later, when Russell loses track of his wife's movements, Williams loads the TV into her eye-catcher from another room. It's an inspired and funny scene in a largely uninspired and silly movie."	1
"Another in a long line of images taken by people who do believe that it is the same to know how a camera is operated as if telling a story. Within fifteen minutes, the whole production is told in just a few lines, so there is no secret that could negate a whole facet of the tension. The half-competent actor is killed 10 minutes into filming, causing villainous characters to flounder and do goofy things. Low-budget movies can't afford expensive special effects so the CGI levels aren't surprisingly inconspicuous, but at least a valid attempt. The creature suit is terrible as one can observe when it falls onto the pavement, and the director emphasizes the look that even doesn't represent the red color of the mirrored photo. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspiring, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The final action sequence is set discover in a police station, also from Terminator, where everybody hides in a single glass office that the Darkwolf does not break. After all, the girl calls the hero ""a good protector,"" but despite an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun, she concedes her two accomplices - the original protector - and at least three other civilians, not с dozen cops, all lose their lives without getting their executed shot. But that's the real culprit for bad writing: the animal could Titanic could have been killed before the end credits, as she was holding the stripper, as well as flashing her red eyes. Instead they took it into custody?! ?"	1
I can't believe so many people compare this film to Argento. His work is far more inventive and mischievous - and much more enjoyable. The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes - and let's face it, these are what the genre is about. It wasn't hard to guess who the killer was and I genuinely didn't care when that news came out. The camera work is not memorable, and I didn't draw on the much-vaunted gothic atmosphere of the 19th century. Some of the actors are pretty good (especially the principal and the sadistic girl ruling over younger students), but they get little done. Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but they add surprisingly little spice. If you look for a good horror film, look elsewhere.	1
"LL Cool J performed better than expected in this movie! He did a fantastic job as a ""renegade"" cop within a ""renegade"" department. From the very beginning, he does a great job of building the spectator's empathy for his character and the predicament he finds himself in. He's got a reputation as a gentle giant -- one whose rough exterior can scare anyone, but whose heart is in the right place from the start -- and he's doing an amazing job. He was clearly the best character in that movie. It was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any prizes. After many major roles in movies like Shawshank Redemption, this one probably was downgraded. Boyd's role in Edison was no way to show his true acting talents - and sadly put him at the back of an order of characters. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have played a central role. That he did not, was disappointing and a real disappointment. I was hoping to see more of him in the film. Timberlake should have stayed in the music business. His portrayal of a young journalist was both underwhelming and unconvincing. This film is a typical action movie showing (at least at the first moment) some similarity with corrupt police operations of the past. As an action movie, he has his share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood and guts. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. After witnessing the start of the movie, there's little suspense about what happens after it - think of what you'd normally expect from a clash between good and bad cops - and it bears little resemblance to 雅 a real police shoot. What annoyed me most was the behaviour of Timberlake's characters during the shooting. He, at first, has weapons but does not use them. When he finally shrugs it off, he fires at them with a gun, as if he has been shooting all his life. t build a weapon - and 30 seconds later he suddenly has two more fully loaded rounds AND additional ammo without moving or anything?! Small plot errors like this have really ruined how the film is told. If what we're looking for is an obviously made-up plot in a fantasy world, where everything will work, then you're likely to love this movie. Personally, I don't care what kind of film it is as long as it's realistic. Let me believe that the story is true. The story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that it left me feeling dissatisfied."	1
"I'd like to make a pun like ""Holmes with Doors,"" but I can't quite put it together. So mangy and overlapped WONDERLAND Kilmer gives a role that Morrison no doubt channels... but how shy is this film about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime novels keep flashing it, leaping over graphic violence instead. As one famous once put it about the double standards in US cinema: ""Kiss a breast and it's an X, bang, and it's action PG-13."" WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long and by the end of the tasteless ordeal we were all happy to have escaped the cinema. How many films are we going to get called WONDERLAND? In the past decade there have been six. The pixelated violence and subdued colors set the dismal tone, but the fickle camera grows restless, as if we were constantly staring at her nostrils. If you take a few clues from the doors and the taxi center, you forget all of that next day."	1
"I hired this flash for a reason Tom Savini, I respect his work, but this was something that was left in the lurch. I had terrible clichés, Half the film is about naked women known as ""fallen angels,"" who wander around like scary characters And then there were the occasional black-and-white camera scenes of ""Blair Witch."" Tom's character was truly awful, terrible. And you have to love the lines they use. ""There is somebody outside who is not funny."" No, but that was your acting. I wish I could give it a 0! Oh, what, the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio; but they left Anthony aside to reunite The Breakfast Club once again in the forest of unforgivable acting."	1
I am motivating this with my observations of an episode that I saw last night (09 / 27 / 2006). I don't think I'll watch it again. The actors were entirely wooden, the plot entirely predictable, the ending completely unrealistic - I mean, who would believe a verdict of $30 million over the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The leading actor (Victor Garber) seemed so unpleasant, almost embarrassing in his role - maybe he realized how bad the writing was!! I am well aware that the drama offered this season is quite sparse, but surely the other writers are better able to balance these two. Maybe they will outsource scripture to India or China!! I bet we won't see that next season!	1
The action is instantly recognisable. Daughters of a divorced couple try to bring mum and dad back together. Yes, that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the Sixties, Eighties and Nineties. But the same is the scary thing. Though Deanna Durbin is younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills, Durbin still looks much older in adulthood. Just like all her so-called siblings. And this confusion between adults and children runs through the whole film. The girls wear cute little sailor outfits, yet they look ridiculous, since the director seems to make every effort to emphasize her ample booty and gauntlets throughout the film. It is always torn to think of them as children or women. If Ray Milland and others start to 'hammer' them, one gets the feeling that they are paedophiles, and their identities might also be known. Teenies or seductress, girl or fox, you are never quite sure how you should picture these two. Parents also seem very old and the whole movie comes across as very old-fashioned. It's a rusty version of the parent trap and you should avoid it, or at least ensure your tetan tinnitus shots are up to date if you don't believe me.	1
"I haven't heard one great thing about the 2006 TV miniseries Planet Earth, narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough, among other things. But whether or not it was shown here in Australia, I never got round to it, and when I happened to see 'Earth (2007),' a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage on a big screen, I tried to seize the opportunity. The stage enge was virtually empty. Just another guest sat in stitches in the front of me, and it was as if I had not only the big screen to myself, but the entire planet Earth as well. For 90 minutes I was plunged into the beauty and danger of the isolated wilderness, in the middle of some of the most beautiful creatures ever captured on film. Awe-inspiring in its scope but at times painfully intimate, Earth is an intimate call by the filmmakers to acknowledge the delicate balance of life on our planet and see how the invasion of man has brought countless magnificent species of flora and fauna to the brink of extinction. Even though the film, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, is clearly designed to preserve wilderness, it avoids bumping us over the head with propaganda and completely ignores the riddle of politics; indeed, there is no human about it. Instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the grandeur of nature to experience the resilience and also the fragility of life on Earth. I have learned that the original mini series, which ran for eleven episodes, is deeply penetrating into the scientific backgrounds of the worldwide ecosystems. but i believe that here, The filmmakers make a wise choice to replace information with emotional effect: I cannot remember the last time I felt so inspired. s and is at the same time deeply concerned. By creating an emotional bond between the audience and a select few particular animals, and to some extent anthropomorphic, we're suddenly able to grasp the ""human side"" of every species, and their futile suffering of surviving it becomes less a statistic than an unacceptable one. ""Earth"" is essentially a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it is a polar bear struggling to take her cubs to the Arctic ice or a herd of elephants involving a tramp living on the Okavango Delta as their lifesaving waters run aground. The documentary shows the delicate balance between life and death, showcased in heartbreaking, desperate ballet of booty and predator duplication. Although sometimes, perhaps to appeal to a younger audience, the footage cuts short at the crucial moment, I frequent to shed tears at just how inevitably death is in nature and how much the raw instinct fuels these animals ""last hopeless efforts to survive. There is even a haunting beauty to hunting, either in the low motion, in which a cheetah puts its prey down, {the result of its only fatal misstep}, or the majestic jump of the Great White shark who swallows a hapless sea lion in the ruins of the castle. This fragile equilibrium is fatally disturbed by the selfishness of our own species. In addition to these most important historical moments, small animal scenes from around the world are on show, including birds of paradise from Papua New Guinea and the autumn migration of the Demetz Cranes. Of course, entire films have looked at these species and a inevitable consequence of such sightings is that some of the interesting ecosystems are concealed far too quickly. By deciding to concentrate entirely on the polar bear Elephants and humpback whales who pursue their lifestyle, over some stunning high definition time-lapse photographs, During a calendar year, filmmakers have managed to avoid any structural problems which may result from such a diversity of film screenings. And just 90 minutes to show it. As a result: ""Earth"" made me thirsty for more, and now I will fortunately get around eleven hours of the time when I can identify a copy of the DVD box for ""Planet Earth."" Uplifting and tearful, awe-inspiring and heartrending, ""Earth"" is a truly great documentary experience, and it could just be my favorite 2007 film."	0
"This is the movie Hollywood needs to make more of. No fancy props, no orderly chases, no clever one-liners. Exclusively people who have to do with being human beings. William Macy plays an unlikely heretic who works for his father Donald Sutherland. Macy's is the dutiful son, Sutherland the dominant father. Son wants out of business, father won't let him go. Macy loves his own son, wonderfully played by David Dorfman (""The Ring""). He also begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist. It is an interesting juxtaposition between characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family. There are many touching scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy. And, as you would expect from a William Macy film, it also includes some humor. Outstanding work all round, actor and director. Good to know they can still make a good movie on a low budget in Hollywood."	0
One of the most boring slasher movies ever, poorly acted and poorly written. THE PLOT Five college students who stay in a dorm during the holidays, and yet someone has plans and starts killing them one by one, the main suspect being the creepy groundskeeper John Hemmitt, played by Woody Roll, or might it be one of the five. Not so bad about either and not so great about it, apart from Daphne Zungia, who dies far too quickly and should really have been the lead heroine, and the other roles pretty bland, though as the lead Laura Lapinsky, her charm sometimes palpable, and at the end you feel pity. THE KILLS Can't work out why this has been banned, killings usually look bogus, one guy's hand gets sliidtwice in the beginning, which looks really fake, but the others are pretty nasty, like a girl being run over by a car, one girl being boiled alive and another being burned alive. OVERALL No great slasher could have been much better	1
"Well. As good as John Carpenter's appearance in ""Masters of Horror"" was in Season 1, it's the opposite. With ""Cigarette Burns,"" he has demonstrated that he is still a master of horror, but ""Pro-Life"" is perhaps the worst I have of him. Silly, completely free of spooky atmosphere and tension and despite almost English running time still a welcome change. The script is nonsense, the characters irritating and unattractive, and the ending is beyond absurd. Go to the Cock-Suckers, who originally bought this DVD (one of whom was me), did you see how Carpenter described it? He is actually proud, talking about his best work in a long while and praising the script. And in the comments section, where he notes the obvious shambolic display that took them tively to the final cut, he simply says that he did not consider the error critical to Moyes and simply abandoned it. I am afraid the old master has lost touch. I sincerely hope that I can be prove wrong. I should like, however, to end on a positive note, and to say that the effects on living things are fascinating. Technically, the movie is first-rate with effective lighting moods and make-up effects."	1
"I was initially intrigued by this cowardly and insulting film. The figures are well-known dispossessed young men often lounging bored in a town by the sea. Robert is an outsider, but he has his music, which could have been his soul. Instead Clay turns Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis, ecstasy and the wrong amount. Audio seems to believe in ""refrigeration madness,"" and Robert ends the film as a murderous rapist. One wonders how much experience this young director actually has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control. There is an extremely subtle link with the insurgents in Iraq だ, and we are confronted with explosions and images of war in the course of the nonsensical rape. The film encapsulates the extremism of male peer group members pushed to 妻 limits. The young assailants in London draw parallels to Clay's hateful portrayal of modern men. Clay implies that men just can't save themselves from terrible violence. It is a wonder that the British film industry is permitting money to be invested in films that advocate such divisive propaganda while we in London are still affected by the recent attacks. This is Tony's first film, I'd love it to be his last."	1
This film is terrible. He looks like a litter bin. No crying, no action, hopeless songs. Although the setting is great. I've always wanted to go to Greece. Anyhow, Saif was expected to produce a great performance, but even he has let down the people. Akshay Kumar, known as Bollywood's pimp and the voice of Singh. He was a sensation in that movie. Only for this achievement would Filmfare introduce another award. The toiletries are awarded as the worst performers. The cup should be a toilet seat, by the way. Kareena Kapoor. For a start, she is unlike her sister Karisma. In the game, on the outside or in the body. Now she wants to prove to herself that she can beat them. She's seen in a bikini and tank top, and shorts in the film. I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan lets his future wife dress like that. But, she must have impressed some people to dress like this. And if you ask how, you heed every person who saw this movie. You dream of Kareena Kapoor lying naked with a condom in bed. Including me. Personally, I think she dressed like a whore, but I really liked it. I am forced to give it a 1 / 10, but I would actually give that film a 0 / 10. An unfinished film.	1
Rain or shine outside, one enters a cinema. It makes you happy. (If not, come out immediately.) The light goes out. You settle down with a cup of ice cream. Moving images flicker across the screen. You feel content. And in the darkness you are back at the beginning of time. Sitting by a bonfire... watching the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times a second, and sharing with the rest of his tribe and viewers the pleasure of learning about the unfamiliar twists and turns of the lacht scenario. Those who are not happy with themselves should not post comments. (Long live romantic comedy...)	0
"I haven't seen ""Henry Fool"" yet, but after seeing ""Fay Grim,"" I'm not sure I want to. Perhaps Hartley wants to be the ""anti-thriller"" director - and he was certain of success with this snubbing. Having doubled down on the official description of the woman who discovers her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a risk to national security, I expected a tight-lipped geopolitical drama. Instead, I got an opaque structure, meagre dialogue, sloppy characterizations, a muddled plot and ""tone"" that changed so many times that Hartley could have adapted the script at any time to suit his mood. I can hang on long, with a frustrating, hard-to-understand storyline (e.g. ""Duplication""), because I am having the finished parts coming together at some point. Even if they do not or do not do so, but they do leave questions (e.g. ) and sharp writing, and acting can affect one's own interest. But halfway through ""Fay Grim,"" I had a lethal realisation: I didn't know what was happening, and I didn't care. What a pity, because I do actually like Parker Posey, reduced to working on an absurd figure, who told her to mutate from an indifferent, estranged wife and impartial, clueless mother into a tough, sly, international ""player"" physically capable of man mano mano mano with terrorists. There's also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum may be very good, but he is not capable of overcoming bad decisions as a CIA official. He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I watched him in it. His CIA sidekick is worse; he looks like a fugitive from the ""American Idol"" Nächtte quarter-finals (are there really young CIA agents with coarse licks of hair draped over their foreheads?). And then there's the tacky question of the ages of the characters. Goldblum was 54 when he made ""Fay Grim""; Thomas Jay Ryan, who plays ""Henry Fool,"" was 44. None of them looked older, or seemed older than their actual age. But a key part of the story is that, ""in the seventies"" they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua. Goldblum's character would have been in his 20s, Henry Fool would have been a teenager. Was Hartley ""quirky"" or lazy? The problems were too numerous to list..."	1
"I am a Christian... and I think this film is terrible. No one except hard, Bible-adhering Christians is gonna like this movie. The message is just too close to call. To reach a large audience, one must be more subtle. In every scene you cannot ensure that the Father would wiggle the Bible and carry it in his arms. Ridiculous! Bad direction. The report of the disappeared should have been horrific, but it was ridiculous. Do you leave your clothes on the floor? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies: ""Oh my God! People are missing! "" This scene in the plane is just stupid. Consider this: if you found the clothes of the kinship next to you, you wouldn't just cry ""o my my God."" They disappeared! It's missing! ' And I start crying and shouting. We would deny... to reach that conclusion one would not have come to quickly. See Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite picture is the dog sitting on the lawn next to him are lots of clothes and boots. I nearly fell off the sofa and laughed so much. The music was so bad and so distracting. It was as if the composer were standing in his own world and preparing his own films. ""Here's my chance to write a thriller,"" ""here's my chance to get action!"" Stop telling me how I feel JAMES COVELL A good score reinforces everything that happens on screen... this film needed quite an LOWER score, but that was as much for your ears as it was for making plant-shedding stuff. The script was bland. Just like Captain Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was worse: ""Don't get me! People are missing. "" Brad Johnson was laughing. The outstanding performances from both were the Antichrist and the elderly gentleman (I'm sorry, I don't remember their names). ""), the producers and filmmakers and actors are just fooling... saying"" we're going to reach a wide audience ""and"" Brad Johnson is a perennial actor ""and"" that's like a Hollywood movie. "" I came to the conclusion that they simply didn't know what the hell they were doing. I commend those efforts. Getting the message across to the broad public is a fantastic idea. Film is the best medium for this. Watch movies like REDEDWERDEN, WHY, CONTACT, CONTACT, COMMERCE, YES, O'BROTHER, WHERE ART YOU? The bottom line is that the film had to be made by people with talent and vision. Unfortunately, that was not the case."	1
A delightfully whimsical film with enough twists and turns for a bag of pretzels. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be who she seems. The story is very tongue in cheek < br > and the dialogue skillfully understated. There are hints of humour and intrigue that don't quite tame Posey's characterisation. The supporting cast is superb. The downside? This film needs your full attention almost until we stop and take notes. Posey has more sex appeal when she raises an eyebrow than most actresses all over the body. It is worthwhile, even if you do not understand the description.	0
I suppose any novel as poignant as Moby Dick would not win great popularity with the multi-millionaire audiences fed up with their own difficulties. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is pure chance. In fact, the first half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not a lot of it being kept up for the movie. Ahab Creely (who has a last name and a brother) is the happy but happy man with two legs and intending to marry Joan Bennett, daughter of Dad Mapple. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, wants to marry Bennett, too. John Barrymore is Ahab in a quirky performance. Barrymore didn't completely command the sound in cinema, distributing only the silent movie histrionics and a stage voice in the background that shook the movies industry. Ahab lost his leg to the whale Moby Dick and I have to say that the amputation was pretty horrible. That was all before the code. Still, I'm sure viewers shivered. Ahab then made Joan Bennett's eyes unsightly by hunting down a whale he doesn't actually see. Ċ In fact swallowed by the film Moby Dick, there is no female character he wrote. One of the things Melville did was to hire personalities to fill the crew of Ahab's Pequod ship. Unlike cannibal Queequeg, it contains names, but not personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. I would see this version of Moby Dick purely for curiosity and nothing else.	1
"I criticised the film saying: ""If you can get over the moralising..."" That misses the point. Moralization is quasi in the conscience of the viewer. This is a good film with a villain genre of its own, but a dramatic twist halfway around. This leaves the observer asking: ""What would I have done in this position?"" And I think that's all the filmmaker wants to do. This and the entertainment of the audience is wonderful. I also like it that the violence does not take place on stage but only in front of the camera. We know what just happens; it doesn't get served in front of us, then rubbed in our face like it would be today by the blood and limb manufacturing of the present. Incidentally, it is not about violence. The point is the moral dilemma of the protagonist, cleverly, if disturbingly, resolved."	0
The worst film I have ever seen was the camera work, Crappy Filter, the film was grainy, the script was awful, I think it still goes on as predictably was the big fight in the end. .... some fight scenes were okay, I think. ... some scenes were so bad that they were funny. .. how Sorbo keeps and rides the horse in the end. .. LOL I really mean it. A horse? Oh how can one forget the evil assassins rolling around in the same vehicle throughout the movie - one would think that, after killing key witnesses and federal agents, they would have been traced. ETC, ETC really, really don't care about watching him...	1
I remember when this came out, a lot of kids were spoilt for choice. I think I was a little too old to get worried about anyone, and I was a fan of real martial arts films, which I always thought were a little bit cheesy. In the early 1990s we were swamped with programs like these that made children feel like they were fighting and a Power Ranger or on the 3 Ninja equivalent. I think that at some point parents and filmmakers got tired of it just because we actually had nothing left but hitting the kids and beating them all up, 'the 56-year-old said. A lot of children's movies have a big point to make, and it's enjoyable for your children to both see and get that message. This film has no message at all... it just gets a thousand different content in less than 90 minutes. There are no great visual qualities in the film, but should one expect it? The acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here. The short, fat, hairy aged fart as a powerhouse ninja who was just hilarious. The kids overplayed and the youngest Ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst child actor I've ever seen. The film has a plot that everyone knows well, even before they've read the reviews. 3 Nintender... well, you know, they will fight a lot of ninjas and obviously win... Needed to say more. Sorry if I spoiled it for someone. With all that has been said, kids will love it. This film is aimed at kids and it could only be fun for the kids. If you do care that your child is watching movies about struggling kids, it is a good movie to watch. If you don't mind watching complete rubbish to your children, that has nothing to do with real martial art, real acting or reality, you've found a movie for your children. I say children because I believe that even the girls will like it... I remember all the girls were in love with Rocky. 2 out of 10 stars, because I think the movie could be great for kids, and also a lot of fun for adults... It's beyond kitsch, it's not original or unique, 玫 ️, and I wouldn't allow any child of me to look at it. .. The TV series Kung Fu is filmed on DVD and there are tons of great Shaw Brothers movies. ... Why don't you show your kids things that actually engage them and mute them along the way, perhaps even teach them a few steps, not just how Grandad kicks a man between the legs when glammed up by three ninjas? .. no no no. .. never kick a man between the legs. .. never. that is so unninja like.	1
"I wish I could give this movie a zero, or even a lower number, because losses are what it deserves. I honestly don't leave a film but it was so terrible I couldn't afford to hold onto it for a minute. Please, please, please - for the sake of humanity - skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian film you can be truly immersed in, it's not that. It has unattractive, unattractive leads, a bumbling build-up, ridiculous dialogues and it is unconvincing in any other way. It does not provide entertainment at the most basic level. Everything about ""Mango Kiss"" is so stage engineering it's WORSER than any student film I've seen. As if that wasn't enough, the whole film is relying on a constant (and I mean NO) voice rather than narrative. The screenwriter also wrote a novel because people have insisted on telling all of it instead of showing it. We only assumed that Lou and Sassafras were best friends and had a special relationship, even though there was no character development to illustrate that. The film also continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, and not naturally, but in the form of freeze shots for the actors whose name is written across the screen. There is no introduction, no character development. However, we do not get to know them well. This is the most amateur film I have ever seen. I am gay, I went to see the movie with my roommate (also gay), and we both thought it was a depressing depiction of queer cinema. I'm drängt beginning to believe right now that lesbian / gay films are a huge part of Christian rock. No matter how cruel it is, people will still approach and stand up for it in droves, regardless of its quality. Please do not rent this room!! Instead, we should be promoting the production of gay and lesbian QUALITY movies by borrowing ""But I Rösler a Cheercommoner"" or ""Fire itzen"" or ""Heavenly Creatures,"" rather than swallowing any mindless tripe (tripe for example) from the gay Insect Community. Queer as Folk)."	1
"The film is far too long, much too repetitive, with the male nudity and sexuality (as they say as gays with their own verantworten adult titles) far too gratuitous and unnecessary. Most of the film's first third could get shortened to ten minutes and it was just as effective without harming the audience's patience (and aversion). I saw this film in an early Saturday afternoon in front of an audience that is interested at film festival in experiments or non-standard films such as one without many dialogue, short films, foreign films. In the first half of the movie, a nearly sold-out audience began pilling into a tally of 275 seats, and although the vast majority opted for ""get out"" (yes, it never actually came), I never did, in about 14 years at any number of film festivals participated in, experimental, homosexual and other, That so many people are rejecting a film. This film could easily have been reduced by more than half and would have been as effective as it was. It could have gone in other directions, with a shorter duration, and it would have been much more effective. The way it is, at the moment you can't readily recommend it or I would like to look at it again."	1
"Roy Rogers plays Jesse James and his cheek-to-cheek gamer Clint Burns. George ""Gabby"" Hayes is an ex-boyfriend of Mr Rogers, Sheriff Gabby. As two reporters looking for stories about the elusive outlaw hero, Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) constitute a noteworthy team. Of course, the mistaken identity / imitation is a development of the storyline, since Rogers describes it in his essay ""double function."" Rogers is charming as ever, but there's nothing that elevates his performance above the ordinary - any potential for a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance will be delivered by poor material. Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye are the better pair for viewing than St. Louis Journal reporters - they're the highlight of the film. The songs are beautiful if poorly synchronized. * * * Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm"	1
"I picked that up on the video because Tarantino advised me: ""if (you) don't like that, go out yourself!"" on packaging... seemed like a ringing confirmation.... I expected something similar to ""Death Proof..."" not much actual violence in this one tho, plot, character or dialogue. Look at the poster. It's all there. Stunts and rock. It goes back and forth. A week of the life of a band from Los Angeles who put on a play of magic - on a par with the one you might get at some of the smaller casinos on the Strip, and a stuntman from Australia, new to town... They work, they meet girls, they party. End of story. The band obviously needed this stuff because they are plainly secondary and play a style that was outdated here in 1978. It has to be conceded the stunt muscles of the film are truly spiky - this Australian type is really something and seems largely motivated by love and respect for ""art."" I put them up there to see what crazy thing he was going to do next. I just wish he'd found a better vehicle."	1
I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews on the Internet; I thought Cinderella 2 (and 3 mins) would be a very sweet and funny sequel for everybody - children and adults... like myself, I'm 22 years old. I find it really informative because it contains teaching how to be true to yourself and follow your heart. I found it very animated and voting pressure was very good; so were the songs Brooke Allison sang. Since this film is set in three flashbacks / stories, my favourite is the story of the time when Jaq the mouse became human through fairy and her magic for one day.	0
Cinderella In my opinion the biggest love book I ever told as a child I loved it as a kid and now love vorläuschte Disney-Meisterwerk. This is one of my favorite films I love Disney. I could keep raving about Cinderella and Disney throughout the day, but I'll give you a brief rundown of the story. When the father of a young girl dies, her mother has to live with her sinister stepmother and her equally ugly and nasty step-sisters Drusilla and Anastasia. Invariably the weakest person who has worked all day repairing the household, the poor Cinderella is merely the small mice running through the house, and their dog Bruno as friends. One day, a letter was sent to her house recommending that all women available attend a royal ball. Cinderella finally realizes her dream, her wish and can witness her inviolable beauty. Her ingenuity and beautiful nature help her to win her prince.	0
"Yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men the world over. This lame attempt at comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again we have an attractive ""straight"" hero who can't find a woman who cares about him. Yes, right! And finally, we are presented with a ""likeable, attractive"" gay boyfriend who is actually a fat, bald, ugly old man whom the main character is supposed to find attractive. Even I didn't like him and I'm a fat, ugly old gay guy (but thanks God, not the bald one!). One poor screenplay and, indeed, terrible directing dismisses whatever acting talent might be involved. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from the film business, but he's no different from many of the other hacks working at Hollyweed."	1
"I showed it to my class in Year 6 17 years ago and the students loved it. I thought it was great. The history of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing. They are low-cast, they all play their parts well. The clash between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic stuff. Alan Root did incredibly good cinematography and should have won the Oscar for best documentary film. The copy that I raised with Orson Welles as the narrator (Derek Jacobi) is not alluded to as Sybil's ""Mysterious Castles of Clay"" but is referred to as ""Castles of Clay."" And I think that, with additional star parteises from Welles, and an Oscar push, that must have happened. I was lucky to have just found this VHS. Now it is my children's favorite movie. They've brought him to the recent family celebration rather than a Disney film. If you find this movie, you're really lucky."	0
"What a snoring feast. Of all the nostalgia remakes and new accolades Hollywood has decided on, it is by far one of the most pointless. It was a very meaningless show from the outset and we REALLY do not need a ""modern"" update. Despite the bigotry and sexism that has been embedded in the system from the outset, social issues have progressed so much since the show aired that the show's whole point has been lost (if it has had any at all). Also, what's the point in having a character called Boss Hogg if he's NOT overweight?"	1
"Let's be honest, shall we? Al Gore cares no more about the environment than most people do about the handling of foot fungi. It's a hook! Make no mistake, Al Gore is POLICY. Three years ago he was beaten up in his home state and is in a 55 km / h zone, so he was not in a Hybrid, a Yugo or even a GM metro, but in a LINCOLN (if you want to google it)! Or how about Mr. Gore and his Hollywood pals still taking a private jet full of fidget spinners to the premieres of ""An Inconvenient Truth""? So much for conservation, huh, Al? Anyway, it only takes a minute to subjectively weigh in upon ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and discover the main weakness. While the film depicts seemingly formidable scientists presenting the EFFECTS of the alleged ""global warming"" to the audience, neither scientist can share the alleged impact. For example, I can take a hundred people to a car park 衝and they can show a car that is not driving correctly. But can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY tent? Generally not! A second mistake. How accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (not ah, the toilet had not even been invented then)? What did they have, a June guy in the matchbox? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? How, therefore, do we know with any certainty that the planet is ""warmer"" if the record levels of the past are, at best, highly questionable? Or is this man the sole cause of it? The answer is we do not, because science is NEVER consensus. Thirty years ago, a Time magazine cover proclaimed a ""new ice age."" In truth, any sixth-grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic eruptions, solar activity and El Ninos have more to do with our climate change than supposed ""global warming."" What Al Gore fails to address adequately is that, even if America decides, fully embracing the gospel, to apolitically do whatever he recommends, how are we to get the rest of the world to join him if we do not even agree on something as obvious as terrorism? A. That's wishful thinking, Mr. Gore & you, the former vice president of the United States, know it! If the producers of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" had been true, they would have had Nasa movie titles such as ""Al Gore Wants Attention."" But what I prefer is to ask the question: why did two of the largest polluters in the world, China and India, distort the Kyoto Agreements? Anyway, I've been told that the producers of A.I.T are working on their forthcoming film titled ""Gnomes, Fairies & Elves: Our Endangered Friends."""	1
This film is nothing if not a waste of time, the plot terrible, the dialogue dreadful. The acting is okay, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script for the work. Photography and some special effects are also okay, but even in this film there is nothing interesting to see. There is no logical continuation of the story; the plot threads are complete nonsense. It's not even scary. If a film is to be frightening, it must have at least a small element of credibility. It's not a credible film at all. There are only three characters in the film. Each figure is flat and has no personality. Most special effects and make-up are either bad or mediocre at best. I hope you've read this and don't waste time on this movie, unless you're curious to see a completely horrible one.	1
"against whom? It doesn't help in Rohmer's case that Syberberg approached them a few years later and wrote a startlingly beautiful work on the same topic (with some help from Wagner). Perhaps the film on its release did not look as miserly as it did without the Syberdic film for comparison, which must have been shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources. I can't really remember right now if there are any horses in this movie. All I have learned is that the German version is pure magic, but this one looks like an archival college production. The music... la musique... wasn't even written on IMDb, but based on ""airing from the 12th and 14th Century"" or so... well, it doesn't really help the film. It sounds wonderfully snotty, authentic and kitschy, comme le pimmage mon cher!!! ""Rohmer is one of those French auteurs who likes to think their leading men aren't attractive and simply unfit for purpose,"" defined me. syberberg's Parsifal was adorable and he can be seen in a video on German telly today selling a bicycle he invented himself. ... I shudder when I think of the Syberberg experience on video. I remember the last time I watched the film in a theatre, the pressure was so bad that it became a five-hour travesty. But even then, it will unfortunately feel it Maß that this version offers. Points for seriousness, for chutzpah, but... the film needed just more money for this Beau coup. It does not look like a medieval manuscript, but like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE!! oh yes, it ends randomly with the going to church and throwing in this cheesy Passion Game... blah!"	1
"I first saw it a few years ago on a Sicilian television station that had since been discontinued. Astonishingly The film emerged as a hefty inexpensive DVD from Criterion: not sure what I'd originally made of it (though over the years I'd become a cult The actual performance is even by genre lovers often regarded with modesty), I have decided not to purchase similar and, unlike other similar for me, Unknown Finding Without An Eater (1958). Recently, I came across The BLOB, a Spanish version of the DVD that, interestingly, can be viewed on 개 Special Edition over the course of two audio montages, but unfortunately I couldn't turn off the Spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature! Anyway, I was very surprised at how well I liked the film's production (despite its many narrative shortcomings, about which I'll return later), and maybe this was just an example of ""B-movie"" looseness (uncharacteristic one-lin合こ in nice tones) and a time capsule, Began describes, and illustrates how social attitudes changed in the late fifties. The male lead role was an early one for Steve (n) McQueen and although the actor looked at it with some disdain, his only contribution to the genre turned out to be quite intriguing: not averse to juvenile kicks, but still an essentially decent (and laut more importantly: altruistic) child. The special effects, depicting the slimy and proliferating being, are not bad by their kind and epoch. The film itself reaches a Razor-like climax 勳, culminating in the monster's intrusion on a cinema (which plays the RUSSION OF THE LORD [1953-1973], as I usamced in the recent Richard Koeck reviews but curiously takes the view through all the film's ranks). Incidentally, will be shown at the opening of a satirical Italian show entitled ""Blob""!). Admittedly the jokes I make with this film are rather limited: it is not a film in which the monster is travelling, but it appears in several parts and is never seen by anyone. It is preposterous to have the town's doctor fire on the blob, as if liquid - however high it might be - could be 18% berg-wiped out! ; it's just as ludicrous to let your teen know about the dangerous nature of this (especially if you think that at this point only McQueen actually saw the monster in action)! An inferior sequel followed in 1972 with the title BEWARE THE BLOB! The original was cut back in 1988 (although I don't promise it for long) but I was far from impressed (although I know Michael Elliott loves it). Note: I follow my own reflection in connection with two more collaborations between Director Yeaworth and producer Jack H. Harris, 4D MAN (1959) and DINOSAURUS! (1960)."	0
"No question the spoilers in this movie, the director hacked us too and spoiled this movie in so many ways. A hilarious rip-off of things like critters and gremlins, the film fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horrors of those better-than-best films. It turns into a gross waste of time, with bad actors delivering bad dialogue to an idiotic director who occasionally throws stuffed toys to them. They grapple with that toy, over something like ancient Tarzan movies that used rubber crocodiles shaking it while they scream, and strive to make it look slightly threatening. It is painful to watch and doesn't help because the intellectual 80s fashionistas wear the same clothes. Basically some crazy little aliens, trapped in a film by an aging guard, are finally released after decades of captivity and start engaging telepathic with humans. The guard captain, the fool who kicked them out despite repeated warnings, gathers his gang of friends, who leave in their eighties and embark on smaller adventures together, while they attempt to persuade the Grem... Hobgoblins to return. All life here is saved by the gang of a broken-shackled jockey, his girlfriend, the frigid and embittered girlfriend of ""beloved"" and the young hero, a boy lacking confidence who dreams of seeing his girlfriend. First 伯️, there's the notorious rake fight scene, where the ex-military jock reveals how he was trained to be a fighter in the Army, literally punching the annoying football hero with the wrong end of a raय for hours on end. And then some turned round and shut up in a real cake fight, ending in a rioting nightclub where empty hand-grenades blew up everything except those people standing right next to them. Then the film ends, and if that is good it ends. It's not. Like a train crash, you can't shut your eyes, it's that bad. Perfect fare for mystery science theatre, but god forgive, you should try seeing it alone and uncut. The Serious Fraud Office still has a number of outstanding warrants for the performers and I dare not advise anyone to talk openly about the rake fight. On a good day this is at most two out of ten points."	1
"this is the perfect example of something going terribly badly wrong... so can I advise anyone to look at it? ""Well, I was forced to compete in the tiff competition Verfolgung (I still can't believe it).. and stayed until the end because there were directors there, but that was nowhere near as interesting.. what was for that? The first half (the one worth seeing) features three characters: a hooker, a musician and some officer. The first two lie about their jobs. The third one, however, is the real Liar. . for the second half (do something else. t ruin a good evening) includes a few old breasts and a severe alcohol problem. maybe you will see it another way. .. the Tiff jury (drank vodka?)"	1
I suppose he is essentially writing a remake, though there are very few changes that make it worse. SPOILERS: They are very similar to the original. Melody, Ariel's new daughter, is threatened by Haruri's sister Morgana. Morgana escapes, but keeps her promise to take Melody away from her. Did Ursula have a sister?! And the villain wasn't as great as Ursula. There are similarities here. Medoly is kept out on the seashore until Morgana is captured, but she has no idea, as everything realized when she was a baby. The palace is surrounded by a wall to keep it away from the outside and inside. She goes to the bottom of the wall every day to take a bath and talk to Sebastian, who is not as funny and funny as in the original film. She finds a mussel with her name and runs away from home to find answers and finds Morgana. There are similarities here: Morgana tricks Melody and makes her happy by becoming a mermaid. In the meantime Eric, Melody and King Triton are looking for her. To stay a mermaid she must steal the Trident from Triton. So does Melody, because she doesn't know King Triton is her father. She becomes friends with a penguin and walrus, and it's terrible. The penguins, who live with them in the icy ocean, hate them because they are cowards. So they're trying to prove they're heroes and fail. It doesn't fit the Little Mermaid. And the dialogue between the penguins and these two characters while these discussions is bloody around the ears. You know why? Because the first one had a big story. That here is not magic, and it is not. It's just one example of how bad a lot of sequels are. Melody finds her, and they help her prove herself in Atlantica. As they take the trident, Ariel finds melody with Morgana. Melody is angry with her mom for holding her back from the ocean, so she gives Morgana the trident, before revealing her true face when she snaps it. Ariel and Melody are in their custody. The penguin and the walrus start a fight against Morgan's shark-friend. Sorry I didn't mention it before. They are finally proving themselves. Eric, King Triton and his soldiers arrive, but are forced to kneel before Morgana by the might of the Trident. Melody takes him, throws him at Triton and he rings in Morgana (literally). Ariel then apologises to Melody and thinks it is all her fault. It wasn't! Ariel did the right thing to protect Melody, but they never say that. Triton offers the possibility to live both in the sea and on land. It actually has' a better idea '. She uses the trident to vaporise the wall to allow humans and animals to be together. Then everyone sings a horrible song. THE END. If you have seen it and like it, you have obviously never seen the original. I don't like that because I'm a teenager. I liked it when I was very little. And then when I got older, I realised what's bad about this film. The small old children will enjoy it but they are likely to forget about it when they get to elementary school. Normally I'd think that I'd overrated a movie, and it was better than I would remember to check it out, but not this. It's even worse. History is no exception. If atzung believing if you read this story through, read those comments more closely and you will know some bad points: Well, you know this story now. I'm sorry you spoiled it, but I must point out a couple of weak points. One of the worst things is the animation. Colour is terrible. The original had a beautiful color. Seeing that almost blinded me. The illustrations and landscape design weren't good, either. The original patterns had beautiful, magical color schemes and beautiful underwater landscapes as well as for the land, and it was a pleasure to watch her do so. The music is unbearable. The music here is crap compared to the first. The songs are not well composed and Tara Strong (I think that was her name), who cannot sing Melody, doesn't do it either. She was sometimes singing too high and didn't follow the melody in the song. So much for the melody, and the music itself is not at all beautiful or touching. That is why Little Mermaid 1 won the Oscar, and she truly deserved it. In another film, if this coward existed, he would have deserved the big prize for the worst score. I didn't like the votes. Several people who have played characters from the first page did the same thing. Jodi Benson is an excellent singer, but now that her voice is older, it doesn't fit her. Too deep, no longer beautiful. I'm really disappointed in her and others who were part of that group. If I were picked for this movie just by reading the script, I'd clearly think it would be a bad movie. The characters are different now. Ariel is cleverer now but annoying. They took her character to the extreme and made her mature. In instalments, the characters may only be selected when there is a special reason. In the first she was sixteen. The probability that it will change is slim. In this phase, you become the person you will be for the rest of your life. Screenwriters should remember that. You should think of the character. I suppose it was. I hope you will find my comments useful because I am sure many of you will agree with my position.	1
"Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - ""Finally."" That speaks volumes when you finally find that special man."	1
"I think it was overrated PG-13 crap! At least the performance of BRITTANY SNOW was good, others like IDRIS ELBA were Pfermoff, but the teenagers in the prom like the lead students were not as convincing. The murderer was so stupid and he looked so stupid. The dead were stupid, dull and utterly unoriginal. The film was also very boring and very overrated. It wasn't exciting at all, I nearly fell asleep. It will be another bad PG-13 movie, another terrible IMO. The ending was so stupid and the climax so hurried and boring. The film is also quite slow. Perhaps, the only good thing about this ""Shitty"" party is that BRITTANY SNOW did indeed perform well, as did IDRIS ELBA, but otherwise it was a disaster film and a horrific remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave a 2 / 10."	1
"This is a fabulous film, makes the 1950s look so beautiful. Kim Novak is mesmerising as the witch of today with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All of the supporting actors are terrific, from Jack Lemmon as her office manager Nicky, to Ernie Kovacs as the writer of Magic in Mexico who works on Magic Spekulationen in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as a slightly struggling but loud Aunt Queenie. And then there's the cat - I've no idea how many witches (besides me) have called a cat Pyewacket, but hinted at a zillion. Jake Stewart comes across as out of place, but equally out of place, in this strange underworld of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy ending, which we believe in, because movies of these vintages naturally have this happy ending. Gillian and Shep probably have as much chance of happiness now as Rose and Charlie Allnut in ""The African Queen"" (another unique film)"	0
"I liked how this started, with a fair few special effects specifically for a film 50 years ago. There was an impressive setting. But the film ends with a fairly silly dialogue early in the film when the men all attempt to flirt with Anne Francis's Altaira Morbius. After a long absence in the 90s it was fun to see the actress Francis again, who had mostly appeared on TV since the film was released.. and still plays. Another interesting character was a channeling Leslie Nielsen (""Dr. John J. 凯Adams"") whom I probably wouldn't have recognised if I hadn't seen half of that film, but I almost got bored and a strong desire to go to sleep. I loved that they reworked this VHS video in stereo. But it was a poor effort. This movie is overvalued by ""elites"" and so is ""heavy"" and ""thoughtful."" That is nonsense. It only feels ""smart"" because the rest of the sci-fi films of the 1950s were so daft! Some were if the early scenes had looked good on widescreen, which I had not at the time of writing. Perhaps another glance - this time at the widescreen 2.35: 1 - would have changed that."	1
"Despite the well-honed imitations of futuristic design, clever Asimov premise and Will Smith's reliably cool performance, this film falls short of expectations. The cliches come thick and fast (it's as if waking from a recurring nightmare, a smug cop has the advert for a stubborn lieutenant pick up more, would spoil it - the ending is a mile away). This film, too, is wonderfully acted - cephalo-like, you never get the feeling you've travelled anywhere; what should really be a global disaster never leaves a CGI-specific Chicago. The robots themselves are good in close-up, but the scenes with ""masses"" look more like a bad Disney - the CGI is often exaggerated. And if you can destroy the robots by shattering them, why do they have to inject ""naniter""? You know it's a nerve-racking film when stupid questions such as these get on your nerves before the climax. It could have been great, but it's smaller than the sum of its parts, largely due to the totally predictable storyline that could have arisen from any action film over the past forty years."	1
"Title: Zombie 3 (1988) Director: Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin And the beginning is actually George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead."" When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to direct an indirect sequel, calling it Zombie 2. This movie is the one we know as a simple zombie. You know the one where the zombie fights against the shark! OK, so after this film (in Italy: Zombie 2) was released and brought in a huge lump of cash, then the Italians decided damn well they would. Let's make some more zombie fics! Everything already in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Still confused? The story that is told here is actually made up of many of the stories of American zombie movies that we have witnessed before; the best analogy that springs to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Let's see... there's the government experimenting with a certain poison gas that turns humans into zombies. Can gets into the general population and shebang! We get lots of zombies craving human flesh. A group of people run away from zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. You have to fight the zombies to survive. There was a lot of anger during the filming of this movie. First of all, Lucio Fulci, Alba's beloved Italian ""Godfather of Gore,"" was sick. So he couldn't really get this movie to an exciting end. The film went to two young directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They were doing their best to spice up a movie that already was not so good. You can see he didn't really have his heart on this one. He was disillusioned with it. He gave the offer to producers, basically saying: 'Do whatever the hell you want with this.' God loved her, too. And that's why women and men beery beer-fuelled blisters have such a crappy zombie flashmob with the big Fulci as its ""director."" The main problem, in my view, is that it is simply an exercise which makes no sense whatsoever. There is no substance whatsoever to it. After the first few minutes, when some terrorists steal poison gas and inadvertently kill it, the rest of the story is simply a bunch of empty, soulless characters, not one of whom flees from zombies. In some cases, this might seem fun, when in # 1 the zombie make-up and the zombie action are actually so good and funny and there's a lot of guts in the game in # 2. Here we do not get either! There are then some inspirational moments, such as when some eagles become infected with gas and attack people. That was cool. One scene with a flying zombie head (certainly inexplicable by any logic or explanation), and another scene with zombies emerging from the pool of a forsaken hotel, biting off a poor girl's legs. But apart from that, the rest of the story just falls apart. Endless endless scenes, but they don't help to advance the already non-existent plot anyway. That was my main complaint about this flash. The sets look as if they should be unfinished and the art director is practically non-existent. I hate it when it looks so damn unfinished! I like my B movies, but this movie went down even further! If you ask me, it's closer to a Z-level pleasure. The zombie make-up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the film was shot in the Philippines), so there are a great many Asian-looking zombies. But this is not a big problem, since they are playing in the Philippines anyway. It's the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died for some reason wearing the same clothes. 'It's like being on a zombie movie and having a lot of black makeup (make-up) on your face. One or two might have been slightly more sophisticated, but not good enough to impress. It's just a bunch of nonsense splattered across the actors ""faces. So rewind the clock and the zombies don't look like just crap. That is to say, that there are only deaths. Even so, for those expecting the usual coolness in a film by Fulci don't expect it here, because this is usually someone else's prerogative. And the two actors (Mattei and Fragasso) didn't put a lot of heart into it. When you see the extras on the DVD, you will experience that when asked about his reminiscences and feelings within the film, Fragasso himself does not even consider himself seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and on many occasions he says ""they just had a job and they made it."" And that friends, the last nail on that tree is. There is no love, no heart that goes into this film. And you get half a fucking fucking zombie flick in return. This is just for the insiders or people who want to see and know every zombie flash-mob they ever created. Everybody else, don't bother! Rating: 1 out of 5"	1
"It was a waste of time, even borrowing it on DVD. If super-fast tracking camera is speeding up, we might pay $20 to go to the laundromat and buy popcorn to watch the trolley spin. Jet Li is so much better than that. We can only hope that he won't be tasked with putting another gloss on a clichéd film, such as The One, any time soon. If there's one movie to avoid, it's ""The One."""	1

I went to watch this movie, because I knew it wasn't going to be great. But what I witnessed was too awful to speak of. I don't want to be harsh, it was just the movie, horrible. All in all, it was bad, I mean the SILVER special effects, the acting was not that bad, but it wasn't good either, and sasquatch itself was.... well, not sasquatch. In my opinion, the best Sparquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons. The attack is not violent, but it best depicts the hate. At least it was dressing, not just some half-CGI rip-off. One should only see this movie if one is desperate or really valued someone in that movie. or lightheadedness, MUCH better.	1
"Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a well-to-do upper-class housewife living with her twins and her domineering husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer) in their suburban apartment. Della attends to the twins, neglects their house and looks and disturbs Kenneth. On Christmas Eve she drives to the local mall to get some wrapping paper and finds no free parking. On seeing an old car that was parked in two places she left the owner with a message describing it as a 'selfish idiot'. When the mall closes, the old car's driver addicts her by threatening four punks: Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Sino-American Vingh (Leonard Wu), and Latin Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the mall security guard protects her, Chuckie shoots her in the head as Della speeds her car on the run from the criminals. But she crashes into a wooded area when she is pursued by the gang. She takes the toolbox, hides in the woods and fights the gang to survive. Some days ago I watched the trailer for ""While She Was Out"" and was curious to see which DVD I would watch. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the film, and I'm totally disappointed in this dull, implausible collection of cliches. Della Myers is portrayed as an insecure and infirm homemaker and nonexistent as a wife; motherhood is her only one interest in her concept of family. She is pursued by four thugs who defeat her with a bag of tools that resembles Batman's utility belt. This is why the plot is so absurd that it irritates. The gang of criminals is the usual stereotype of American movies: an African-American, a Sino-American, a Latin American man and an American lord, to be politically correct. Kim Basinger is a decent actress, but her kids are too small for a 50-year-old woman. I have four votes. Title (Brazil): ""Enquanto Ela Está Fora"" (""While She Was Out"")"	1
I 持️ was thrilled when I saw they had made a film from my favorite book. It was only when it was too late that I realised it was Disney. I was horrified at the number of omissions in crucial parts of the story. It was like someone made a film out of a fourth grader's books about the novel. Meg was doing well at school, and neither her father nor she wore glasses. Mrs Murray (Meg's mother) was in no way portrayed as a scientist; they left out their kitchen lab and replaced it with the internet. And this is just the beginning. Halfway through the movie I found myself standing on the screen, to the horror of other people who watched this movie because they didn't read the book yet. I wish there were more thumbs down so I could give four thumbs down. The only good thing that I can say is that this movie is kind of fine for someone who haven't read the book.	1
"I have never read a biography of Lincoln before, so this may have been an accurate portrayal... And perhaps it is because I am used not only to the equally alienating and unrealistically worshipping portrayals of Lincoln as brilliant, honorable and unnaturally reverent himself to the Savior of our country.... But why would they make a film depicting Lincoln as a fool? While Henry Fonda made a brilliant Lincoln, his portrayal of his predecessor as ""a dunce, I'm just a plain guy"" seemed a little insulting. [Admittedly, bushie Jr. 's entire campaign to make us think he's ""just a normal guy"" so we wouldn't care if he's a rich & loveable idiot -- but that's a whole different story.] The film, however, depicts Lincoln not only as a Basic Typist (and almost simple-minded), but also decides sweetly that Lincoln when coming up against the law is something of a coincidence, and that he's not really interested in stuff - just the wrong but simplistic notion that a similarly situated law is about right and wrong. He is not a great defenseman in this film (he slams his fist on the table and ridicules witnesses) and the outcome is chiefly down to luck or chance. Moreover, the series is sadly religious, racist, and conservative, in part because it was Republican-funded (in response to a Democratic play that had been released) and partly because it simply reflects the sentiment of the time. t waste your time with this movie!"	1
It was a pretty good film. I'm not sure it's a troublemaker comment but I didn't want to take that risk. In any case, the prosecutor reads a verse from the Holy Scripture at the end of the film and then quotes from memory. I can't remember the first passage he reads but the second is Genesis 9: 6. He says it is Genesis 9: 12 but actually quotes verse 6. This is a well-known passage that many use to defend the death penalty. It's a pity accusers don't dare to quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first Supreme Court justice in this country's history? He said the Bible was the best of all books. Too bad we have lost that vision in America.	0
Forbidden Siren is based on the Siren 2 Playstation 2 (So Many 2s) game. Like most video game-shot films, I would say that most don't really translate well into it being a different medium. And, even in this case, this is painfully true. The story and the mythical island, the setting for the story with a writer (Leo Morimoto), and his children Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama), move in, is explained by quite a long prologue. The inhabitants don't seem too friendly, and soon the best advice to take on the siren on the island was to stay indoors as soon as the sirens start sounding. It becomes unhunchback, of course, and our brothers and sisters get on the air to find out precisely what is happening in that unpleasant island with its strange residents. But, Ruddy said, the truth is, you're not going to worry about what's happening if folklore and fairy tales are thrown in to make the act even more confused. What really pushed her into the realm of bad comedy was her unconsciously ill-placed briefs, which simply giggled at her sheer stupidity before being explained much later. For one thing, trying to come out smart, for another, trying to make a convincing case based on contradictions. Though it reaches sub-90 minutes - I believe as a running time federal it's a terrible film phenomenon - its slow pull means it's nearly two-hours in length, so it conveys that feeling of saying or doing what it wants. It then rises again in the last 20 minutes but it's a classic case of too little coming too late. The film saves as he turns back and presents his revelations at the conclusion. This too is a common technique with which one tries to turn the seemingly simple horror film into something extra worthy of itself, in the hope of wowing the spectator. It's all gone pretty well but leaves an unpleasant aftertaste as you will feel a little cheated. There are two ways Commune will make you feel - either it elevates the movie to a memorable level, or it'll make you feel ugly. Sadly the forbidden siren belonged to the latter. The saving grace will be its cinematography with the use of light, shadow and mirrors, but I make this clear - it is still not worth time, so better to avoid it.	1

"So many educational films are pure scaremongering, saved only by MST3K pouring scorn on them (""Why Study Industrial Arts?""). I remember). ""Hemo the Magnificent"" is actually well done. It is about blood, heart and circulation. I admit that <unk> doesn't always share that sentiment, but he did a good job of explaining everything, keeping it serious but entertaining. I suspect you can always rely on June Foray (best known is the voice of Rocky, the squirrel that plays the deer here). Perhaps the best way to find ""Hemo the Magnificent"" is ""Gremlins,"" where a group watches while a gremlin forms."	0
"Years ago, after seeing a heavily censored version of this film on television, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was astounded that it was played more credibly and better than I thought but one thing really stood out. I think other critics have mentioned this as well, so what exactly is the nature and the motivation of the character Chris Sarandon? Has he raped other victims? Is he totally psychotic or an ""average sociopath""? How did he expect to get away with attacking his younger sister? Is that character credible at all, or is it merely a question of background information? At the same time, he appears almost equally as an uncomfortable-seeming creature who is too crazy sophisticate to actually hold an apprenticeship, which gives him contact with vulnerable young girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint from viewers in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is frighteningly convincing; the film occupies a troubled position between pure exploitation and more or less serious treatment of the subject, with no degree of scholarship. Not the worst film we've ever made, but not very good either."	1
"So I'm hearing about this new Justin Timberlake film that is coming out and has some pretty big names. I mean great actors like The Freeman aka Morgan Freeman, a win for Hollywood as well as being wasted in this movie. Then there's Kevin Spacey, of whom I've been a huge fan since seeing American Beauty and The Usual Joke. These two extraordinary actors probably chose it and thought it would be a great movie, as I was doing when I heard about it. And then a freshly minted Justin Timberlake. I say fresh in their faces, because this is his first film and the rotten tomatoes have yet to meet him. Well, the reason could be added because no one will ever see this film or even bother to read this review. The film is so horrible that if I earn in the first 15 minutes. The figures were so one-dimensional some of the biblical figures resembled that of Don Corleone. They got one-liners and some really sharp stuff. The recalcitrant black man (LL COOL J) who misses being with an extraordinary woman he does not usually belong with in real life. The captain is that short, weeping guy who talks in such a high tone. And what a crappy movie it would have been if the hero hadn't made something of his life. Oh and the level of gun fire, I mean a lot. SPOILER (NOT!!!) It's a kind of gun ownership drive that leaves everyone in the police seat that has fallen out of the saddle - and the hero prevails. They were given flamethrowers and rocket launchers, not really a joke. Bottom line, if you want to see Edison that's because you're a big fan of an actor or a big fan of Justin Timberlake, all the 13-year-old girls out there, have fun!! I wish I had more hands, because then I would have more thumbs, Cause this movie is so terrible because then I could make it with a lot of thumbs down that thumbs down, t mean much anymore because this film is so horrible because it sucks so hard that I laughed out of frustration at the plot prose, because they just do not end because the shooting and the The shouting just doesn't stop. May G * D burst upon us all and save us from ‣ these dreadful films. Now it could be the worst, another horrible actor RNB turned singer was horrible actor is usher, hehe check out in the mix lol, or even get rich or die a try. "" Now the special about the film is that it's about 30-plus-year-old men who perform 16 or even younger teens. I could go on."	1
"I remember watching it on television on a Saturday night in the 50s or 60s. It was well presented, but I remember that during one of the last crazy executions, there was a message of hope, beamed out from channels set up by lampposts. I am not sure this is true. Still, the film is a good one. ""The Russians are moving down Fredrich Strasse,"" reported the German high command moved and without further ado as if it had gone everything as usual. My impression was that this movie, and later an American TV film, based on the account of British historian Trevor Roper, with a similar title Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised they didn't take Trevor Roper to task. I agree that the latest film on DOWNFALL was as well made as the classic. The American knockout win was a bit flat. Hardly any other character cause as much stir in the cinema as Adolph. But I find it interesting that none of the numerous films and books that have Ｅ[ The Hitler Double] been mentioned in passing in John Toland's magnificent historical work. A Gibs?"	0
The concept for Sarafina seems to be founded, leaving aside the musical perspective. How: Froome retains an interest in combining good African music with a story that outlines the horrific conditions and atmosphere that blacks were subject to on the set of the film back then. The contradictions between the two elements are too stark and the film never justifies such a rapid switch between exultation and terror. If this was just a drama, if it were about those conditions, it might well have been a good film, but the scenes of Shulkin being shot down by soldiers don't quite fit the songs. Apart from Anfield Road, the acting is not the best, producing a mediocre performance as do the rest of the cast. Overall a disappointment. 3 / 10	1
"This is a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is such a thing as intellectual horror cinema, it is this film. I began to get anxious and wanted someone to catch up with me, and there's barely a plot! I have to watch this film several more times before I feel I can really understand it. If you love ""My Dinner With Andre"" and films of Godard, or if you are on lots of mind-altering drugs, you will probably enjoy this movie. Wow."	0
"I really enjoyed this film, but it is nothing new. Everyone here groups the whole picture with other war films, this film has been wrongly categorized! Just as a war film like ""One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest"" is not an asylum film, or ""Cool Hand Luke"" a prison film. It's a film about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the cost of this type of personality. The plot - as it feels like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"" - is his in the cold. Those films should be folded and compared with one another, not a ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon."" Eric"	0
"Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work at Sharpe's, hoping to live his dream lifestyle, but he struggles to make a lasting impression. Based on Toby Young's book about surviving in American business life, this comedy-drama got mixed reviews from critics. As for comments labelled contradictory but charmingly by Können, the decision to lose friends felt like an animal crossing a pond; as I make fun of another cultural comedy that ain't. This 2008 ggenheim picture is working because of its actors and simple but sharp story. We start in the past, then in the present, working our way forward to see Young establish himself in one of America's top magazines. Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too sympathetic to words. Whether it's taking a cricket bat to your face or showing your sidekick the nature of the law, the English actor brings charm and hilarity to every scene. MB, if the script is good, but far from his perfectionist self, brings together a lot of energy, and it's worth it to see it. His antics with ""Babe 3"" are unforgiveable, just as breathtaking as his exuberant dance, but he draws it through magnificently. Bridges and Anderson do a great job of portraying the stereotyped magazine bosses to whom Dunst fits a kinky love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, makes everyone watching her resemble a stereotypical movie star with her funny exaggeration. That her character Sophie Myles also stars in a picture of Mother Teresa is as ridiculous as her character's antics at the pool. To emphasise the point: Here's a dog, and Pegg rounds it all off in this serious Brit comedy, with a really nice little twist. Despite being a British film, there has been an adaptation of the American lifestyle for Young as he attempts to fit in, and we can see the different approaches to telling stories. Young wants the wacky as opposed springtime professionalism. The addition of modern tabloid stars will soon date this film, but the concept of film star exploitation hoffe bestows this advantage. Weide's first picture isn't perfect. There are lapses in concentration, the plot becomes too soapy with an inevitable uncomfortable twist, and there's too many characters who are required. The physical comedy can also be exaggerated. By the way, the clowns on the DVD, with a length of nearly half an hour, are one of the most beautiful you will have ever seen. This comedy drama has Simon Pegg back in sparkling form and with its collective approach to storytelling and sharp comedianism, it's well worth seeing."	0
"I saw the film ""Shackled."" Generally speaking I liked Dolph's movies, so they tried me. It wasn't worth it. I have read some of the previous comments about the box and been seduced. Don't be fooled. This is a bad movie at best. There's no acting. The act, of which there is not much, is very predictable. At times, the film seems hacked. This one just stinks to heaven. Not even worth the price of a cheap overnight stay. As a bit of a dolphin fan I was hoping to see him in action. At the end of the movie, you will have to wait. The best thing to do is avoid this film and spend your time watching almost everything else."	1
"This film could be used for a course on ""How Not to Write A B-Movie."" There are bound to be hardships in a B movie: budgets are tight, time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The only aspect over which you have complete control is writing the best script you can write within the constraints that are imposed on them. Scarecrow's script seems written in a haze of drunks. I might go through about 15 examples of this film's nonsensical script, but I want to mention just one: The Gravedigger. About an hour later, the character of the gravedigger is introduced into the film. He doesn't seem to have any connection with any of the characters that are already in the film. He is seen with his daughter, who is also unrelated to anyone else in the film. The funeral director is shown grumpily performing some scenes, then being shot in order to conceal the number of dead. Why give a daughter to the gravedigger? Why give your daughter a boyfriend? Why do you introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the story I'm writing? Scarecrow doesn't seem to care. Scarecrow's ""story"" runs something like this: Lester is a high school kid (played by and actor who was supposed to be in his early 30s) being taken up by the other children. He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate called Judy. His mother is voluptuous and the razzle-dazzle. One of the damn board-mates pokes fun at his drawings (calling him a ""swan"" who drew birds rather than ""monster jealous and cowboy."" If you have a high school student who nonetheless draws cowboys, I think it is more likely that he is gay than an undergraduate student who draws crows) and later kills Lester under the eponymous scarecrow in a cornfield. It's a fairytale process, and Lester's soul appears in the scarecrow. Somehow this transfer transforms the soul of Lester from that of an artist to that of a wise-catching gymnast (I know that in some accounts the scarecrow was called the kung fu scarecrow. I disagree. The scarecrow does a near-full floor exercise before hitting the truck during the climax of the film.) The scarecrow then kills those who tortured him, those who smoke pot in the corn field, those who dig graves, friends of sons of gravediggers, and pretty much everyone else who've appeared on film sets. The bonus feature on the DVD should be mentioned. The director (a Frenchman) does an improvised version of rap music because Admittedly, he enjoys the absence of managers on set, so it means his wife can study Østad a lot, and quotes a quote from his years (and me, from the script): ""Life's a bitch. But et has a great drink ""number of beers I drank during the film: 5 Did it help: No number of beers needed in order to get into this film: In whatever way it takes to reach the blackout level"	1
"I agreed with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowsky. Barney seems to be utterly dull and ""content-wise"" uninspired. erhält He can make eyes goofy (and I like sweets), but his arrogance and profound artistic emptiness will only belittle the joy. I fear though that many people aren't choosing between similar works (Moonlight and only really on the surface) by Jodorowsky or even linear-minded filmmakers like tarkovski and Kubrick incidentally (I love the 2001 Odyssey and was never bored even in the last scenes. ..) This kind of art as M. Barney's works now confuse and fend off audience members who might otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema. Typically empty post-modern ""Conceptual Art."" And check his interviews. I just don't buy it myself, sorry. And so boring. I've never been bored watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a total disappointment. Especially given the opportunity to be something, actually tell something non-linear and unorthodox about Cantrack (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and preparations for the ship's sailing). Boats ""meet"" at sea... ideas of the excrement as a valuable object (when it comes to droppings). These ""pearl divers..."" anything could construct a huge surreal movie with some content. But it wasn't. AND those terrible pretentious scenes of fancy dress, giddy tea ceremony... how vain and wrong and philosophically pretentious yet empty it can be? I have some great, picturesque scenes, but the whole movie became so dull and pretentious and completely empty and pretentious that it made me physically sick. And it doesn't have a good pace. I like slow-motion movies, but in some scenes it was just boring - because it was pretentious and inauthentic - so I was just forced to sit through continuous scenes of artistic vanity... This sort of film for me permanently killed art and spirit. I want more Jodorowsky!! !"	1
"This project was originally conceived as an adaptation of the popular Japanese manga SlamDunk! and that is nothing new for Jay Chou, who just made his film debut as a character from a very popular manga adventure. And in this context it was decided to include in the film a new type of Kung Fu 物, hence the title, even though the idea was not very original, and one felt there to be at Stephen Chow ""Shaolin Soccer connected with martial and ball games. Yet he is not taking big steps in the right direction. Luckily, The scenes in which kung fu did influence the course of the game were kept to a minimum. and in Kung Fu Dunk, really quite unnecessary, because they neither contribute much to the plot nor generate great excitement, and at most offered a few cheap laughs and reminded us of the time when Stephen Chow was beginning to use kung fu in football matches. Jay Chou is comfortable in his role as the martial artist Fang Shi-jie, since this is not the first time that he has competed in martial arts (Curse of the Golden Flower who? Ching Siu-Tung is one of the most ambitious gangsters in the world, and under the stunt directed by Ching Siu-Tung, he looked so believable that he mutilated scores of gangsters in a bar, as we know them from the trailer, so you can only know who his boss is. s why Malaysia accepts him almost as a Kung Fu practitioner, and he gives him an excuse for being a superior shooter who can shoot the hoops at any angle. And when Eric Tsang becomes a small time candidate, Chen-Li, who sees his potential and becomes his agent, he goes to college to play varsity basketball; but not without first being refused by team captain Ting-wei (Chen Bo-Lin) and team star Xiao-lan (Baron Chen, in his appearance). But you know teams from the same side are coming together quickly, if they want to play other opponents on a basketball court. And I would stick my neck out and say that this movie is for basketball, like the goal agazine has been for football. He made the athletic look good thanks to his charismatic character, even though they trickled so much cool and irreverence onto the pitches. Special effects and wire play were used here which meant that the actors looked like pros doing some top job in the NBA and quite frankly looking sensational, particularly if they imitated dungeon motions and made combo moves thanks to technology and stunt artistry. The pro-kung fu elements don't have to belong to the film. The stunt work itself militates much of the moves since they are pretty much grounded in reality, only to abandon the notion that average-height boys have feathers to skip over to such a height for a professional boy. And part of the problem is that the important part is that the games were very limited in number, with time spent on a lot of them, but they were loosely developed and peeled out from history. Things like Shi-jie's attempt to take advantage of basketball games, to his parents one day visiting them, which imbues himself with gangsterism nonsense and affects games and his love life with Charlene Choi in yet another vase role just to look good and do nothing else. Everyone acts a bit too cool, leaving the main characters little room to add depth. One of the main themes here is the recognition of the importance of teamwork and not individual talent and skill, It could have been much better if the footballers themselves had communicated a lot more off the pitch more than just concentrating on and at competitions, Except for the high-fives and free passes. With a $10-million budget, it's possible to immediately see where the money has gone, perhaps at a crucial point in the film, a tremendous fantasy sequence. It is easily doable, respectable zwanje and probably even justified for its quality but I would like to stress once again that even without those elements, the basketball stunts would still make a decent film with clever basketball moves themselves. And letting Jay Chou play for your team gives boost to all hopes of box office success."	0
It is pleasant and fast-paced. It's not impossible that the actor who plays Mat might be eighteen. But the most important thing is that he is very convincing. It is probably thanks to his audition that he convinced her to employ him. I soon accepted him as a naive boy from the countryside. While it was the best performance, the others were very engaging. Especially the interaction between the police officers was natural, balanced and worked very well. It is only about 45 minutes long and therefore the action is not complex. More important is the style of the whole thing. It is very slick and lively, and the settings are atmospheric, especially due to the fact that all colors are extremely appealing. Gangland is recognisable to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly Australian.	1
Joan Fontaine plays the villains in this Victorian period film. She convincingly plays a married woman with a lover by her side, and she even takes aim at the wealthy Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is also quite good as Miles. Miss Fontaine did her part to perfection - she was smart, calculating, innocent, timid, and charming at the same time. It takes an actress of exceptional talent to pull it off. Joan Fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in Travis Banton's elegant costumes. Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine, also stars in the film as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this film.	0
The Unborn tells the story of a married couple named Virginia (Brooke Adams) & Bradley Marshall (Jeff Hayenga) who genug tried to conceive for five years, Virginia had two miscarriages and is desperately hoping to have a child. They visit Dr. Richard Meyerling (James Karen) for help, after she advises him some of her friends say he can help them have a child. Dr. Meyerling starts operation on Virginia & it soon becomes apparent, that the operation is successfully performed & Virginia is pregnant. At first it all seems perfect & the marshals could not be happier , but their perfect life does not last long as Virginia develops a couple of problems during pregnancy. She gets moody & behaves totally out of character & gets a disturbing phone call from Beth (Jane Cameron), another woman, the Dr. Meyerling's tactics, which use the natural police for its sinister purpose, are really an ill-fated genetic engineering researcher. Virginia begins to wonder what is growing inside her... Produced & directed by Rodman Flender, I thought The Unborn was a decent horror / thriller (no sci-fi film, after all, such as IMDb would have you believe) which pleasantly surprised me. The screenplay by Henry Dominic is trying to be different and you should at least credit it. The unborn rely on psychological horror instead of cheap scares and bad special effects, it is a reasonably thoughtful story that is based on fundamental human fears. It comes at a good pace, even if it is not by any means an action-packed film. The climax was good & seemed a fair way to bring the case to a close & the warnings about the mess with genetics seems even more relevant today than they must have been in the past, perhaps Flender knew something the rest of us didn't. At its base, there is a lack of some exploitation elements and a longer range of settings in this film. And it is mainly a dialogue-tinged film that concentrates on a human and which can occasionally become a bit bland. I have to mention, what does this grinning skateboarder dwarf actually make of Erath?! Director Flender does a good job. Unborn may not be the most stylish or visually interesting film that's ever been made, but it's good enough. The atmosphere is good and a good deal of tension reigns, because only at the last moment is the dark plans that Virginia and Dr. Meyerling have revealed. It's disappointing that the blood of Gore almost does not exist, which is disappointing for the movie in a way, because there is nothing that has really been done in retrospect, but I think in a week's time I'll remember her too much. Technically the film is OK; I would imagine the budget for The Unborn was pretty low, but it's well made, albeit a little bland and forgetful. The baby is actually a good special effect & has some pretty realistic facial movements. Shooting is good & it's been one of the biggest jobs of Friends (1994 - 2004) star Lisa Kudrow せ, I have to be honest I don't like Friends & I don't even know if it was, so all of a sudden I can't tell you how it worked. The Unborn is a good horror / thriller worthy of being known & seen further, it's a lot better than the lot of cheap shit cramming the shelves of video storeshine baum. If your horror fan is looking for something different, something more intelligent and thoughtful, I think it could be a lot worse than The Unborn. Below I removed an astonishingly run down continuation of the film (The Unborn II, 1994) and then watched it right after, please click on our review if you want to...	0
"Whether you are viewing the regular version of this monster or the MST3K version, you can only be impressed by the absolutely galvanizing attitude that has been invested in this production. The filmmakers insult the intelligence of the viewer at one end. Apparently, they will not be interested. Everything about it is absolutely cheap. Even the 1950s car in a flashback to that era looks like it was pulled from a junkyard. The 'tree spirits' are, as you are probably aware, 'realized' by poorly designed hand puppets and stuffed toys, and it is clear that, when anyone is going to be assaulted by them, the toy is held onto the victim's body. The pictures show (or rather are not) the animals scurrying away from the security guards as they point their guns at the guards beteiligt, and turn their heads as if looking past the hoblins. This is reminiscent of the scene in one of the films ""Tangents"" in which two people stand in the ruins of a future world and examine the rubble, and we stehende they are not shown. Budget constraints, allocated with extreme incompetence, usually mean you are not worth having anything to show for it, so why should you try? The ""stage sets"" were totally ridiculous. ""Club Scum"" was an obvious sell off: the house looks like an empty house, probably for rent or sale, occupied by the production company for an hour or two to film. ""The space"" would be something I would have been ashamed of when I was 10 years old. s motives make no sense - Kevin is vilified for inferior disdain for a girlfriend because he does not make her ""proud of him."" I am sure this was meant to make their reconciliation so touching, but any guy with real self-respect would have told her to go to hell and leave. Nick is reportedly back from a two-month army training course (rik, nice adjustable haircut, Nick steps in anyway) and seems determined to prove that our country is defended by sadistic, crazy animals who are sex maniacs. Kyle is a telephone sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a spandex-clad dominatrix, he is freaked out enough that he's gay Tesla is more of a boy than a girl. One of the girls is prudish, the other hooligans. And the goblins? In the end they all return to the vault in which they have lived for thirty years. Why so? Who knows? Who cares? Watch this movie and you will be amazed at how primitive filmmaking can take delivery of in our modern Veränderungen, when you have an idiotic book, an incompetent director, actors so bad that they are excluded from high school theatre productions and Edward D. Wood Jr. ""s set."	1
"Come on folks. This movie is better than 4. I see it happening... Rich people have done crazier things. And it was funny. I watch a comedy in order to keep myself amused, escape the pressure of the world for a while and not to have to take anything too seriously. This film fully fulfills this purpose. I judge a film on its merits and I won't compare Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles. I watched as dysfunctional people grew into caring, sympathetic people who could easily live on the streets of their homes. She will remain on my list of ""favourite things to do for the holiday season."" If you want to have 90 minutes of fun, check it out here."	0
"""Broken Bow"" takes us back to the beginning. 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This part of the ""Star Trek"" franchise is in my opinion the first show since ""TOS"" to revive the feelings of wonder, danger and enthusiasm of ""Going Where No Man has Gone Before."" Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer, first captain of the ""Star Ship Enterprise."" He and the entire cast show real devotion to the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley excels as the alien Doctor Phlox, and Jolene Blalock is utterly compelling as the alluring but logical Vulcan science officer T'Pol. Broken Bow is, in my opinion, the best first performance of any Trek, and I think Gene Roddenberry would be very proud of that."	0
"I saw the film several times in the late 1960 ""s / early 1970"" s when Kernan rode insist on playing this lovely Tudor reindeer with rabies in November / December as a Saturday matinee for the children. It was always a tough competition for DER CHRSTMAS (""THE CHRSTMAS, Oooh""), THE ALAKWASN'T (""Oops... can I really say"" Christmas ""Carl. ), perhaps the greatest, most iconic Christmas movie of all time. But this is another review. Back then I wondered if the colour of the previous ones on the screen was almost 'pink and white' and that the colour of the prints was accidentally pulled off by a single pinion. The movie is kind of creepy! I thought then - and I still do. I was delighted then, as I am today! This is amusing in a way that benefits a ""slowed down elf."" By the way, the image quality on the present DVD looks much better than in theatres, about 1969-74. Who perhaps expected to forget the ""Lost Christmas Special by RANKIN-BROSS""! If you CAN DO FELLINI - keep reading... The dubbing of these foreign films (Spanish version here) always makes you Ⅱ ""surreal"" by nature. This magnifies the appeal of the movies. It's also pretty scary, as an ""insane demon"" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the whole movie turning decent kids into ""baddies."" A really nightmarish scene shows a little ""loophole boy"" wishing himself parents for Christmas - but suddenly the ""Port family"" comes forth from a huge amount of ""Christmas gift thoughts"" until he realises that he has only one daydream! See that, love -- and if you're a rock, save your wands -- this film will make you think you're hallucinating... without drugs!"	1
"'Why? ' this simple question had to occupy every New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. The same word will no doubt य️ re going to pose the same confusing question 22 summers later, when people will leave cinemas, as it did when we saw the trivial, exploitative ""Summer of Sam."" Director spike Lee tries to weave the story of a pack of misguided villains in search of the celebrated psychopath - who crippsentenced New York City to more than a year's worth of misery - with a graphic depiction of the killings. ALEX, the demons in Berkowitz's head and the frustrations of a futile manhunt for the NYPD. It features an ensemble of mean losers who, in life devoid of love, honor and humanity, hear their own barking dogs - no different from Berkowitz's. Lee rails against the audience in almost every scene - ""none of us is what we seem to be."" Often seen as an outsider of the GOP white establishment, Lee perpetuates stereotypes by inserting a scene in which Mira Sorvino, who plays a bride-to-be with a cheating husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black boy ""on the foot of a big black Cadillac."" An Italian mafia boss tells a black detective that rival 24-year-old Willie Mays ""famous catch was a"" stroke of luck. "" Lee even alludes to racial reflections of a middle-aged black woman, who declares, ""I am glad one white assassinate all these white people, because if one black assassinated all these white people -- there would be the greatest racial uproar in the entire history of Manhattan."" Except for the outstanding opening shot of a disco entrance (reminiscent of shots from Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and Orson Welles' The Third Man), the movie has no soul, purpose, or passion. He parades characters on the screen, deprived of human decency. Even if we know nothing about the real victims of this terrible robbery, Spike Lee seems to be saying that New York got what it deserved during that harrowing, boiling summer of more than two decades ago. ""How can someone do such harm to his reviewed city?"" ""How can someone show such hatred toward his fellow man?"" Are these the right questions for Berkowitz or Lee? They decide."	1
"When you watch a movie with Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers, you think it's not going to get anything. But what can I say? It was a terrible failure. Not to mention Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a truly odd young man, let alone an attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The film is incredibly incoherent and I did not understand everything. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny men, but this film doesn't prove it. This song about Arabella- ""Cinderella"" is pretty cool, but that's about it. I recommend this film only for those who want to see a new movie that is almost the definition of such a movie. I think this film is above all a sign of the times: regarding its sturdy experimentalism and its erratic unconventionality, the problem is that 麥[ it] is fully quality and the script, not to mention directing. There will be no missing Peter Sellers either; he will be moving around from ""Dr. Strangelove, Forever Forgetting You"" to silly movies such as this one and the smoothly witched Christian, who was very similar to that film in terms of context and style, but this movie had some funny moments. This one is pointless now and I'm sad that somebody as great as Peter Sellers was in that film. Not recommended for everyone."	1
"I was very surprised by this film. I was touched by the lives to which Paulie addressed on his way to find Marie, that little girl he was separated from. The humour was also very good and it did not do the story as much harm as I'd thought it would probably child. I was expecting ""Paula wants a blast"" jokes would hurt the movie, but even that happened in a very cabaret scene which would be very touching when Paulie was in the press room in the research lab. So, if you want to see a good movie called Animal that Talks, watch it, in my opinion far better than Dr Strangelove. PAULIE also has a surprising twist at the end, which also succeeds nicely."	0
"Fascinating. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that, with the great story being told, will touch only the tip of the iceberg. From actors to the rare visual effects, ""LOST"" is the essence television show for fans of science fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, and mysteries. Each cast member is so well chosen and so good in their roles, you either love them, hate them or just wish them dead. The visual effects are indeed rather well-organised, after occasional use (which is a rarity), given the usual production of shows. Whether it is the ""smoke monster"" of polar bears, defeat is a sight to behold. As for the storyline, nothing compared with the enormous complexity of the show, which makes viewers like me put up with it. Beginning to end, continuity is almost perfect, characters are developed, and the developing story starts to provide the answers to their lines that many yearn for. Overall, there is virtually no error in LOST. It is coming for the drama / science fiction television sperrt as well as for the comedy ""Arrested Development"": It has set the bar high. To all those who love patience, mental and the moment of trip, I recommend LOST, no matter how long it takes until they reach the end. Watch this show."	0
"Reign Over Me is a hit because of the powerful work of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Where comedic actors playing dramatic scenes have previously been seen as a distraction, Sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles. Most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temper and vulnerability that can burst at any minute. It might even be a metaphor for characters with such hidden anger problems. But this performance is quite dramatic in contrast to his roles in less-comic fare like Punch and Judy or spanglish. In the film, Alan Johnson (Cheadle) meets his old college roommate, Charlie Finerman (Sandler), whom he hasn't seen in years. Five years earlier, Charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash. Charlie barely acknowledges Cheadle's character diplomatically due to the repression of memories and his determined, childlike life since the accident. It's only when Alan insists he engage him in conversation that Charlie remembers who he is. Your new relationship, what will ensue, will allow Finerman to have a friend who won't talk about his loss, and who will ultimately confront him with the thoughts and feelings he repressed in his own way. Though writer-director Mike Binder displays little sense for a stand-alone style and some of his settings and transitions are a bit clumsy, he has a knack of from actor to major artist. He made the film with a digital camera - as is increasingly common in film-makers today - allowing the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting. I used the colourful backgrounds of New York City, but created the common digital grain that resembled bruises scattered and moving on the screen. Almost all the main characters in Reign Over Me are excellent. Jada-Pinkett Smith and Liv Tyler are remarkable in both roles as Cheadle's frustrated wife and psychiatrist. Sandler and Cheadle are the ones who deliver some of their best work to date. They owned this film 100 percent. Sandler, in fact, plays a character who can't seem like him on the outside - often wearing his Bob Dylan-esque wig. Cheadles' character has more screen time than Sandler, but both are considered leading roles, as they show equal support and help throughout the film. Music also plays a big role here, particularly the title track, ""Reign Over Me,"" as well as The Who's ""Love, Reign O'er Me,"" later covered by Pearl Jam. In one of the film's most impressive moments, Sandler is seen using music to push away his feelings and memories, but it is this song that evokes so powerful emotions that it does not abate his anger but stimulates it. All in all, Reign Over Me is an enjoyable, sad, yet often hilarious movie driven by its astonishing lead actors."	0
"The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) enters the studio of the scammer and antiques-collector Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and poison specialist Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he Ahmet is Jack's brother. Jamie doesn't buy his story, dominates Jack and pins him to a chair. When Max comes Jack suggests $100,000 each to protect Max in a court battle with a rich, dangerous collector over ""Spanish antiques."" Max invites a silly acquaintance called Piece (Mark Boone Junior) who joins the team as a back-up along with his back Spezial girlfriend - who believes she is from Mars. Jack, however, crosses the line and then intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece. The low budget film, ""Spanish Judges,"" is a reasonable screenplay with a terrible ending and a good cast. Valeria Golino is astonishingly lovely, but they and Vincent D'Onofrio - a good actor - fail to save the nonsensical story. Moreover, the scenes that are supposed to be funny do not work, and they are actually stupid, not funny. I have three votes. Title (Brazil): ""Tudo Por Dinheiro"" (""Everything for money"")"	1
Boring, predictable horror-outing by number has still some pretty good special effects and enough (mindless) chaos to satisfy (mindless) genre fans. Usually, it's about gigantic rats attacking a number of characters we don't care about - if that's your thing, get involved. (* 1 / 2)	1
"Michelle Rodriguez is a well-built high school student who discovers she has severe strokes and starts working out at a gym in Brooklyn. Santiago Douglas is a good-looking, young man, barely older than her, who trains there as well. They meet almost after class and feel drawn to each other. No sex. Santiago was instructed to rescue him for the other fighting. Both are participants in a 'gender-blind' athletics program that makes no distinction between men and women, a misguided attempt to regulate the sporting field. A conservative radio commentator recently announced - and I swear I don't - 'Let me take this as my own, the President is black.' I am here to make an equally sharp observation: ""Men and women are different."" Currently, in 99 out of 100 cases, this is not necessary with regards to physical performance. But in the top 1 per cent - skilled sportsmen whose skills have been pinpointed - the men usually have an advantage. With their narrow hips they can run faster. And they have greater muscle mass and upper body strength. These differences in body structure enable the women to have and educate children, while the men seek and kill food for themselves. This sexual bifurcation is the result of a totally normal process of natural selection. Without them, there might not be anyone. And that's why, in the Olympics, they have special events for women, instead of events for men. As your anthropologist, I speak to you. That's ten cents that PayPal prefers. That is why I misdirected this gender blind programme. As talented as Rodrigues may be, the closer she gets to the zenith of the game, the more she will end up losing against a man. And therein lies the difficulty in this film. Rodrigues finally gets up against her friend Douglas. Neither wants to quell the anger of the other, not to mention equality, but both are at stake, and this pride is personal as well as gender-based. Douglas is refusing to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what she considers the patronizing posture. It ends happily. I didn't really expect much from the film. I thought I was ripping off Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" until I discovered it had been released many ȁyears earlier. And I had never heard from the director or any of the actors. This kind of opacity is generating mistrust in all forms - pre-programmed crying, just in case, and so on. But I was surprised at how well it put together. The complete absence of my swimming trunks made my mouth wide open. As was the minimal use of boxing clichés - the frayed strands, the blood, the lacerations on the swollen eyes, the battered faces after the fight, the sweaty spectators shouting: ""Kill it! , slow motion at landing of a glove upon a nose, a beam of sweat from the dug up head and heroic music signal the long awaited apotheosis of the winner. None of that here - well, almost nothing. The whole plot could be considered formulaic. Tough Child finds a chink in the armor of the ring What one has left is the feeling that these amateur contests are probably like that. Unlike on TV and in film. For example, no bells ring, instead a dancing and attentive referee yells ""Stop!"" And ""Box!"" The participants wear headgear. The gymnasium 玮is not populated by a crowd of cheering spectators, but by a handful of people who are particularly interested in the goings-on. It's a tidy film, despite the rather gloomy setting and unfortunate family dynamic. Michelle Rodriguez looks rather mean, in terms of her muscular delivery and glow in her lowered eyebrow but when you get used to the feeling that this woman can hit you at all times, she wants it and you hear the feminine outlines of her super segments, she's not evil. (A scene of her throwing her father to the ground is exaggerating it.) It was a little difficult to understand Douglas's reluctance as Rodriguez crawled over him in bed. Director Karyn Kusama has chosen her talent carefully. Shows what can be done with talent, imagination and a little money. There should be more such films. Take one such billion-dollar blockbuster full of dinosaurs or spaceships, and spread some generosity."	0
"It was part of the ""Video Nasty"" film selection of censorship measures Britain set up in the 1980s. Keep the bloody stuff out of the hands of children, you know? Many might have wondered what all this was. By today's standards, Unhinged is a tame little fairy tale. Three girls are going to an electric jazz concert... and they already know the same number of people will attend. They get lost in the forest and suffer a car accident that looks so underhand that it's ridiculous. They are picked up by some local people living in a spooky house in the woods. One of the girls is seriously injured and has to stay upstairs. Then there is the talking. Reasons why the girls should come and how they should be on time for dinner because their mother doesn't like them. And talk more. Jakkidiyak. There is a certain amount of tension when a mad guy runs around molesting the girls and somebody looks at the pretty girls through holes in the walls in something that looks like Hitchcock's Psychtreffer. I digress, because there's so much Blabla in this film that you wonder when the murders are to start. In fact, one of the girls is bored so much that she is searching alone in the woods for the town. Smart move. She probably knew about the lonely virgin strolling alone in the forest but she did not care. Then we will go on talking and wait and a bit more wait until the next girl is killed or not. And then there's the twist end. ""expectable"" for some spectators, and perfectly happy for others. Probably the only reason why someone would really want to see that. I don't mind how much it's twisted, since nothing in this movie makes up for the most boring time I have had to watch it. Even with the small impact of the end, the director didn't have what it takes to make a really good story. It would have been a much better 30-minute-an-hour TV episode, telling the story of Tales from the Darkside, for example. If you really have to afford it, perhaps to say that you've watched every Slasher movie, do yourself a favour and have the Forward button ready. Since the film has so many trivial scenes, you just zoom through and you get to the ""WOW it's been like that all the time Mir"" -ending. And halfway through the film, there's a shower scene where the two girls are fighting. Horror for bees. These beautiful humming bees that make honey."	1
